            <itunes:summary>Three big hitters are out this weekend: Edge Of Tomorrow,
                Maleficent and A Million Ways To Die In the West. From the first, we've got
                director Doug Liman, here to talk about taking over Trafalgar Square and
                shooting his friend's wedding videos, while from the second, we've got Sam
                Riley, whose gravelly voice will make your brain rumble. As for the third,
                well... Seth MacFarlane's a busy man. Outside of the interview department, the
                team talk about Edgar Wright's Ant-Man anticlimax, Quentin Tarantino getting
                back on the horse for The Hateful Eight and what to expect from Jurassic World.
                Then there's your usual dose of movie chat and reviews from the guys who like to
                occasionally do Sam Riley impressions (but never when he's actually on the
                podcast).</itunes:summary>

                The Office (his character's full name), but this week Martin Freeman is actually
                Lester Nygaard from the new TV version of Fargo. He talks to us about everything
                from the joys of swearing to Billy Bob Thorton's pathological fear of
                antiquities. Elsewhere, David Cross drops by to talk about the new film he wrote
                and directed, Hits, and we resist the temptation to grill him about Arrested
                Development, Mr. Show and The Increasingly Poor Decisions Of Todd Margaret.

                Gyllenhaal (End Of Watch), director Ben Wheatley (Sightseers) and producer
                Stephen Woolley (Great Expectations) all dropping by to talk a whole load of
