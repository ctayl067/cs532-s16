   Suns: Scorpio Sun in the 7th House

   [12]astrolodew:

     Your sun is in the 7th astrological house, in the sign Scorpio.

     Scorpio, known to be passionate, resourceful, possessive, focused,
     determined, probing, and perceptive is expressing itself through the
     house of companionship, partnership (business, romance,
     competitors), and marriage in your chart.

     To acquaintances, you are externally calm and controlled with
     perhaps even a bit of a skeptical or cynical air, but internally
     quite emotional, affected, and concerned. Your emotions are
     frighteningly intense at times, leading you to overcompensate and
     produce a rather sarcastic shell that other might find a bit of a
     pain to crack through. Being individualistic, self-assured, and
     confident in at least the way you operate, though, this doesn’t
     bother you too much.

     However, this feeling of only needing yourself isn’t felt 100% of
     the way through. Deep inside, you recognize that life is meaningless
     to you if you don’t have someone to share it with. This is in direct
     conflict with your tendency to shrug off the opinions of others.
     Without a balance in attitude, you would end up isolated and
     depressed because of it. However, foresight and charm are two things
     that come naturally to you, so friends are never too far off when
     you start to feel like you need them again.

     As an individual with a strategic mind that is quite sensitive to
     power struggles, this inner contradiction might be a source of great
     exasperation for you.

     One thing that will never be up for debate within you, however, is
     your loyalty. Even if you sometimes want conflicting things, you
     would never impulsively leave behind those you have pledged yourself
     to. You may be known for running a bit hot and cold, but you will
     never be known as the one who betrayed their friend or cheated on
     their partner, and that means quite a lot to you.

   THE SIGNS AS TYPES OF ANGELS

   [20]informativeastrology:

     Seraphim (”These are the angels who are closest to God. They
     encircle his throne and emit an intense fiery light representing his
     love. Seraphim are considered “fiery serpents” and not even the
     other divine beings may look at them. There are only four of them
     and each has four faces and six wings. When they come to Earth, they
     leave their serpent appearance behind, preferring tall, thin,
     clean-cut human embodiments.”)

     The fire signs;

     -Aries

     -Sagittarius

     -Leo

     Cherubim (”These angels are the keepers of celestial records and
     hold the knowledge of God. They are sent to Earth with great tasks,
     such as expelling humankind from the Garden of Eden. Ancient art
     depicts cherubim as sphinx-like, winged creatures with human faces,
     not the fat babies with wings that now grace greeting cards and book
     covers. Ophaniel, Rikbiel, and Zophiel are cherubim, as was Satan
     before his fall to evil.”)

     The air signs;

     -Gemini

     -Aquarius

     -Libra

     Thrones (”Thrones’ appearance is perhaps the most bizarre of the
     first grouping. They are said to look like great glowing wheels
     covered with many eyes. They serve as God’s chariot and dispense his
     judgment in order to carry out his desires for us. The angels in the
     second choir can exist in a state of transition between the
     celestial and human worlds. They are considered heavenly governors,
     attempting to strike a balance between matter and spirit, good and
     bad.”)

     The water signs;

     -Scorpio

     -Cancer

     -Pisces

     Dominions (”Think of dominions as middle management. They receive
     orders from seraphim and cherubim, then dish out duties to the
     “worker bee” angels of the lower orders. Their main purpose is to
     make sure that the cosmos remains in order by sending down power to
     heads of government and other authority figures. Zadkiel (sometimes
     called Hashmal) is the chief of this order.”)

     The earth signs;

     -Capricorn

     -Virgo

     -Taurus

     Virtues (”Shaped like sparks of light, virtues are in charge of
     maintaining the natural world, and they inspire living things in
     areas such as science. They also take orders from the angels above
     and convert them into miracles for the deserving. When they make
     themselves known to us in their earthly form, they are musicians,
     artists, healers, and scientists who work with the power of love, as
     well as physics. The two angels at the ascension of Jesus are
     believed to have been virtues.”)

     The air signs;

     -Gemini

     -Aquarius

     -Libra

     Powers (”In their celestial form, powers appear like brightly
     colored, hazy fumes. Powers are border patrol agents between heaven
     and Earth. They are the angels of birth and death. Some believe that
     they also preside over demons who wish to overthrow the world, while
     others, namely St. Paul, thought the powers themselves were the evil
     ones. In any case, powers are a group of experts who serve as
     advisers in terms of religion, theology, and ideology.”)

     The fire signs;

     -Aries

     -Sagittarius

     -Leo

     Principalities (”These angelic beings are shaped like rays of light.
     Just like a principal in school, it’s the principalities who oversee
     everything. They guide our entire world – nations, cities, and
     towns. What’s more, they are in charge of religion and politics. As
     if their plate isn’t full enough, they are also in charge of
     managing the earthly duties of the angels below them.”)

     The earth signs;

     -Capricorn

     -Virgo

     -Taurus

     Archangels (”They, along with the angels, are guardians of people
     and all things physical. But don’t call on them to help you
     personally; archangels respond best when dealing with matters
     involving all humankind. They are the first order of angels that
     appear only in human form. As such, they function among us as
     pioneers for change in the form of explorers, philosophers, and
     human rights leaders. This order is most commonly known because they
     are mentioned by name in the Bible – Michael, Gabriel, and
     Raphael.”)

     The air signs;

     -Gemini

     -Aquarius

     -Libra

     Guardian Angels (”Guardian angels are the angels who spend the most
     amount of time caring for human beings. They watch over people
     during people’s entire lives on Earth, and their primary job is to
     protect people from spiritual and (sometimes) physical danger,
     according to God’s will. But guardian angels also pray for people,
     guide people, and record people’s deeds. Many people believe that
     children are especially close to guardian angels.”)

     The water signs;

     -Scorpio

     -Cancer

     -Pisces
