[42]About Ladies On Tour

   Nienke Nijenhuis at the Welsh Open Ladies on Tour

   Ladiesontour with Nienke Nijenhuis at the Welsh Open


   My interest in Ladies Golf started when I attended the Ladies English
   Open at Chart Hills Golf Club in Kent. Not ever seeing a Ladies Event I
   was surprised that the players didn't have caddies! I followed one of
   the players, pulling her trolley, she seemed so alone that she was
   christened "lonely girl" Following the event I joined the forum on the
   LET website and got chatting to players, caddies and a chap called
   Steve Homer.

   The following year I was again at Chart Hills but this time I was a
   caddie thanks to Steve. It was great fun and I met some wonderful
   people, players, caddies and some of the LET staff. I went on to caddie
   again at Chart Hills until the final Ladies English Open and also
   caddied in Holland and Wales.

   In the meantime the LET stopped the forum only for Steve to start the
   LET fans forum and asked me to help in running it. Welcome to the World
   of Media!

   Steve also started a new website [43]www.ladiesontour.com which again I
   helped out with and is the site you can see before you now.

   Myself and my partner Maureen moved further into the media world when
   Steve invited us to the Dubai Ladies Masters, an opportunity not to be
   missed.

   In late 2009 Steve made me another offer that I couldn't
   refuse.........to take over and run Ladies On Tour.

   I started to build the site up and managed to get to the British Open
   and the British Masters with Maureen behind the camera lens. With the
   site growing and new ideas we decided to go for a total re vamp which
   is where we are today.

   Please keep checking the site as we have new ideas, articles and maybe
   something a little bit special! As an addition the the golf news we
   have added articles on the latest golfing equipment and clothing,
   follow this link

   the main header.

   Dont forget to look through our news "archive"
   [45]http://www.ladiesontour.com/news or follow the "News" link from the
   main header. Please also click the [46]site map for a full list of
   articles on the site.

   We now have the Ladies On Tour Golf Store, for all your Golfing needs,
   please visit the [47]http://www.ladiesontour.com/shop or follow the
   link from the Home page.

   To all the visitors who have been with us over the years I thank you
   for your continued support and send a warm welcome to all new visitors
   to Ladies On Tour.
