British Embassy
Jakarta

     * English
     * [16]Bahasa Indonesia

   Location:
          [17]Indonesia and [18]Timor Leste

   Part of:
          [19]Foreign & Commonwealth Office

   UK and Indonesia enjoy a close relationship, with many common interests
   and values. We are partners in challenges like terrorism and global
   warming, and work together closely within the G20. We are also here to
   support and protect UK interests in Timor Leste.

   Britain is a leading investor in this country. In April 2012 the Prime
   Minister announced a commitment to double trade (goods & services) by
   2015 to £4.4 billion.

   We cooperate with international and local agencies to address global
   challenges including human rights and democracy, regional security,
   prosperity and climate change.

   We also provide assistance, services and practical advice to British
   nationals visiting or living in Indonesia, and we deal with visa
   applications for those who wish to enter the UK to visit, study, live
   or work.

Our services

   We develop and maintain relations between the UK and Indonesia. Our
   work covers a range of issues including building and improving trade
   and investment between the UK and Indonesia, and working with Indonesia
   on global challenges such as climate change, countering violent
   extremism, human rights and democracy, regional security and
   prosperity.

   We also provide services at [20]British Consulate Bali.

   [21]Check our opening hours.

   Indonesia call 020 7008 1500.

   The British embassy can’t help with passport enquiries. Contact [22]Her

   You can apply for an [25]emergency travel document (ETD) if you’re
   abroad and your passport has been [26]lost or stolen, damaged or
   expired, and you can’t get a new or replacement passport in time to
   travel.

   If you’re due to travel in the next 24 hours, [27]contact us as soon as
   possible. Otherwise book an appointment at the Embassy in Jakarta or

   Office on 020 7008 1500.

Support if you’ve been arrested

   We’ll do all we can to contact you within 24 hours of being told that

What the embassy cannot do for you

   Although we try to help British nationals in a wide range of
   situations, we cannot:
     * help you enter a country, for example, if you don’t have a visa or
       your passport is not valid
     * give you legal advice, investigate crimes or carry out searches for
       missing people, although we can give you details of people who may
       be able to help you in these cases, such as English-speaking
       lawyers.
     * get you better treatment in hospital or prison than is given to
       local people
     * pay any bills or give you money (in very exceptional circumstances
       we may lend you some money from public funds, which you’ll have to
       pay back)
     * make travel arrangements for you, or find you work or accommodation
     * make business arrangements on your behalf
