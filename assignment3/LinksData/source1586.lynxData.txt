   [36]LL Cool J Says Tithing Is The Key To His Successful Hiphop Career

[37]LL Cool J Says Tithing Is The Key To His Successful Hiphop Career

   by [38]tamikahall | Dec 14, 2015 | [39]Church & Ministry,
   [40]Entertainment, [41]Music, [42]News
   Rapper and actor LL Cool J appeared on Hot 97 in New York City for an
   interview last week where he discussed elements of his personal faith
   including his tithing. When asked about his over 20 years career in the
   world of hip-hop and how he’s been able to maintain relevance all these
   years with his music and acting in shows such as NCIS, he credited God
   and also discussed the importance of giving, more specifically tithing.
   “I mentioned earlier longevity, versatility and originality,” LL Cool J
   said. “What I didn’t mention was spirituality and believing in God. He
   continued: “Every dime I get, no matter what it is, I give 10 percent
   to the church. I’m a life-long tither. I believe strongly in giving. I
   believe you got to have that faith. And I’ve seen it work in my life,
   because as much as people in the world like to take credit and claim to
   be geniuses, at the end of the day there’s a higher power than you, and
   you got to answer to that power.” The interview also revealed that the
   hip-hop pioneer and legend attends Greater Allen African Methodist
   Episcopal Cathedral in Jamaica, Queen, New York, which is pastored by
   former Democratic congressman Floyd Flake. LL Cool J further commented
   that he’s “unique” and “an anomaly” in the hip-hop industry because
   he’s been able to maintain his career while others are no longer in the
   business. “I’ve been blessed to be able to transcend eras,” he said.
   “That’s like a blessing. I’m kind of an anomaly. I’m unique in that
   way. Sometimes the stars line-up. God gives people... [43]read more

[50]Kierra Releases new EP ‘LED’

   by [51]tamikahall | Nov 21, 2015 | [52]Church & Ministry,
   [53]Entertainment, [54]Music, [55]News
   Today, award-winning singer, fashion designer and television star
   Kierra Sheard has released LED, an EP that had her teaming up with her
   brother, producer J. Drew Sheard II and contributing producer Jor’Dan
   Armstrong. In a similar vein as recent full-length public releases from
   artists Beyoncé and J. Cole, Kierra decided to forego the tradition of
   promoting singles through radio in advance of today’s release.
   Available digitally on iTunes, the 8-track EP is made up of an array of
   sounds and styles that will give you a back-in-the-day vibe. The title
   track, “LED,” has a strong sound and message that is sure to keep your
   head bobbing while listening. Other songs on the project include “Make
   Me Better,” “Oh Jesus” and “So Easy,” and all will have listeners
   transported to wherever the music leads them. On what helped inspire
   Kierra to give LED the sound that she and J. Drew did, she says, “A
   youngster who knows real music. You’ll hear a 90′s feel in the
   presentation of this music. Prince-inspired, Marvin Gaye-inspired. My
   goal is to give listeners a sound that they can take everywhere. I’m
   hoping to put God in people’s atmosphere and they not even know it
   until later. It’s something for in the meantime, but it’s fun and
   creative.” Be sure to catch Kierra on her four-city pop-up shop tour
   for her new high-end, full-figured clothing line, Eleven60. The tour
   will include stops in Atlanta (November 21st), Washington DC (November
   27th), New York (November 28th) and Chicago (December 4th). Kierra is
   also touring with Tasha Cobbs on her “One Place Live” tour. For

[58]Jonathan McReynolds to go on tour with India.Aire

   by [59]tamikahall | Nov 21, 2015 | [60]Entertainment, [61]Music
   Acclaimed recording artist Jonathan McReynolds continues to deliver
   inspiration to audiences everywhere following the chart-topping release
   of his sophomore album Life Music: Stage Two earlier this fall, which
   was an immediate hit on Billboard’s Top Gospel Albums chart, remaining
   #1 for four consecutive weeks. Featuring hit tracks “Gotta Have You,”
   “Pressure,” “Maintain” (feat. Chantae Cann), and “Whole”
   (feat.India.Arie) among the album’s 13 songs, McReynolds debuts the
   lyric video to his latest single “Whole,” a contemplative duet that
   Yahoo! Music has hailed for the “perfect harmony” between him
   and India.Arie’s vocals. McReynolds will also hit the road for a series
   of special performances this holiday season, just-announced as a
   special guest joining GRAMMY®-winning songstress India.Arie for most
   performances on her upcoming Christmas With Friends tour. Performing on
   the Christmas With Friends tour in December, Jonathan McReynolds will
   make appearances in Washington, DC (December 14, Howard Theatre); New
   York, NY (December 15, Gramercy Theatre); Philadelphia/Glenside, PA
   (December 17, Keswick Theatre); Memphis, TN (December 20, Minglewood
   Hall); and Nashville, TN (December 21, Schermerhorn Symphony Center),
   with tickets available online now. Taking his indelible songwriting and
   searing performances live across the world, in addition to recent
   performances in New York, Washington DC, Norway, his native Chicago,
   Virginia and more, McReynolds’ other upcoming tour dates include
   Charlotte, NC (November 23); Fresno, CA (December 4); Oakland, CA
   (December 18); Hampton, GA (December 31); and London, England in
   January. Check out Jonathan McReynolds’ lyric video for the single
   “Whole” (feat. India.Arie), from his album Life Music: Stage Two:

[64]Patti Labelle Sets the Record Straight about her Pies

   by [65]tamikahall | Nov 21, 2015 | [66]Entertainment, [67]News
   It looks like Patti LaBelle isn’t too fond of people suggesting James
   Wright Chanel‘s viral review of her sweet potato pie is responsible for
   its massive sale spike at Walmart. When approached by TMZ, LaBelle said
   that while Chanel was a “lovely” man, she was selling out pies long
   before the YouTube sensation’s funny video hit the Internet.   “I did
   it myself,” she said while walking into her hotel in New York City.
   CHECK HERE TO SEE VIDEO “I was selling out before the guy did [the
   video].” She did, however, note that the video was “beautiful,” even
   giving Chanel a shout out. “He’s a wonderful singer and just a
   wonderful guy,” she added. Some may disagree with LaBelle’s notion that
   her name alone led to the booming success of her now sold out pies.
   Within the days the video was viewed over 8 million times, customers
   rushed to Walmart in hopes of getting their hands on a pie. Walmart
   said it was their most visited item online and second most searched
   item on the Internet after turkey. A rep says pies would not be
   restocked until December, and that the company was in the process of
   ordering over two million pounds of sweet potato to produce larger
   quantities of the dessert.... [68]read more
