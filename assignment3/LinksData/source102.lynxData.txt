     We recently enlisted Toca Electrical to carry out work in our new
     extension. All went well, team were tidy, always punctual and
     polite. Would recommend.
     - Danny & Mel, Eltham

     I had a few electrical issues that needed sorting so I called Toca
     Electrical. They came around the same day, carried out the work
     required and also gave some good advice on other electrical matters!
     - Tim, Grove Park

     Had some problems with some new spotlights I had previously
     installed. I contacted Toca who arrived, inspected the problem, and
     rectified it very quickly. Very pleased.
     - Tony, Chislehurst

     We recently purchased a new flat and wanted some electrical work
     done before moving in, so we contacted the team at Toca who met the
     outright deadline and carried out the work brilliantly. Thanks
     again.
     - Andy & Abby, Chislehurst
