   [33]Review, [34]west end gluten free

   dominic-teague “Why would you choose to come to a gluten and dairy free
   restaurant?” laughs one of my fellow diners. He owns one of the few
   burger chains that doesn’t offer a gluten free bun, so you can guess
   his feelings about [35]Indigo, the free from restaurant at One
   Aldwych. Those of us in the free from community however feel a little
   different about it…

   Not many coeliacs [36]missed the headlines about Chef Dominic Teague
   making the menu at the only restaurant in a central London hotel
   completely gluten and dairy free. But incase you didn’t know… He didn’t
   tell anyone. Not until three months after the new menu launched after a
   kitchen refit.

   Now what this experiment does confirm is a number of things that those
   who live on a restricted diet will tell you: 1) simple food cooked well
   can be gluten and dairy free 2) it can still be delicious 3) your
   guests won’t even know 4) it doesn’t need to be full of additives and
   taste like cardboard. And Indigo does exactly that.

   Surprisingly I was the only guest at this press event who was on a
   restricted diet. This is partly because, I believe they don’t want to
   be known only for their free from catering. They also want to be known
   as a fantastic, West End hotel restaurant as well. Strange that quality
   and free from food aren’t always associated isn’t it?

   To be honest, I went feeling a little skeptical about the free from
   band-wagon this hotel restaurant seemed to have thrown itself onto. But
   I left pleasantly surprised. Let me explain.

   IMG_0966

   First of all, the menu being entirely gluten and dairy free is only
   mentioned in the small print, where you would normally find the
   “special diets make yourself known and we will see what compromised
   meal we can find you”. I liked this. Subtle, but when you speak to the
   staff you really know you are in safe hands. They are confident talking
   about procedures in the kitchen and ingredients used.

   IMG_0975

   They make as much as possible in house, including their own gluten and
   dairy free bread. Currently this is little individual loaves of
   samphire, onion and buckwheat bread that is savoury, almost cheesy (but
   obviously not), but a cake-y texture. A signature of free from bread,
   sadly. However we were given a taste of a work in progress loaf, which
   was dark, soft sliced bread, like a gentle textured rye, which was much
   more to my taste and will hopefully be on the menu soon. All are served
   with little bowls of olive oil for the whole table it preventing the
   drooling over ‘real’ posh bread as I often do.

   The a la carte menu is succinct with a seasonal selection for each
   course. Starters included Heritage Beetroot Salad, Rhug Estate Pork and
   Truffle Mayonnaise, Hand Picked Dorset Crab with Pickled Mackerel or a
   create your own salad for starter or main. Main courses featured bang
   on season Breast of Pheasant and Celeriac, Rhug Estate Lamb Rump with
   Samphire and Brixham Monkfish braised in Spices. Simple, seasonal food,
   that is naturally free from.



   My choice of starter arrived as a fan of unbelievably thin roast pork,
   sprinkled with slithers of Granny Smith, shards of crackling and a
   rather generous shaving of truffle. All perfectly balanced on eating. I
   had to choose the fish and chips for main. Widely available yes, but
   not always very well executed. It was a test. But this was by far the
   best, most flavoursome proper fish and chips I have had. A delicate
   portion, with a truly punchy tatare sauce, the batter made with GF beer
   sealed the fish perfectly and there wasn’t a patch of soggy batter in
   sight.

   To have a choice of more than one dessert was a real treat. However for
   me, as a coeliac there was slightly too much focus on fruit and not
   nearly enough innovation here. Polenta cake? Pineapple Carpaccio? But
   this is the only concession to the menu and I believe it’s purely
   because gf and dairy free puddings are tricky to master. And as Chef
   Dominic admits there is a lot to learn, and he is doing this as he
   develops the menu.


   Saying that, each one was still really delicious. The Amedei Chocolate
   Mousse gained menu supremacy, made with coconut oil instead of cream
   whilst the accompanying DF pistachio ice cream simply seemed like an
   excellent ice cream. Maybe I should have tried the polenta cake… Ah see
   that’s the problem when you have a choice. One that I seem to have
   forgotten!

   Overall, I came away less skeptical. [37]Indigo have genuinely
   responded to a real demand at their restaurant and I applaud them for
   making it both gluten and dairy free. However what they are doing here
   is pretty simple, and something much of the restaurant trade could
   learn from. Simple seasonal ingredients, cooked with allergies and food
   sensitivities in mind mean everyone can enjoy a top class meal without
   compromise.

   The service was excellent, attentive, and subtle, and staff had real
   confidence about handling allergens. Overall it was an excellent
   experience – I wasn’t blown away or massively excited, it was for me
   just very good seasonal cooking. [38]My approach to eating out gluten
   free is to challenge the status quo. But to have a reliable venue in
   the heart of the Covent Garden that you trust to create GF and DF meals
   without drama is brilliant for the whole free from community. And with
   a 3 course set menu for £25 it can also be great value too.

   Please note that the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon tea
   can be made both gluten and dairy free, but you need to book this in
   advance.
