[19]Goalscoring touch eludes Boro and Leeds

   [20]Monday, 15 February 2016 [21]Gabriel

   Middlesbrough went a fifth game without a win after a 0-0 draw at Leeds
   on Monday night. Their West Yorkshire opponents put in an aggressive,
   intensive display and for long periods, stopped the promotion
   challenges from finding their passing rythym. Positive substitutions
   gave way to an open second half in which both teams had their… [22]Read

[23]Welbeck winner highlights Arsenal’s adaptability

   [24]Monday, 15 February 2016 [25]Gabriel

   A long held criticism of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been his
   stubbornness, his refusal to acknowledge the strengths of the
   opposition and change his tactics accordingly. And yet, after a 2-1
   victory over Leicester on Sunday, the Frenchman deserves at least an
   ounce of credit for the way he set his side up. Any plans… [26]Read

[27]Butcher bags winner as Burton beat stale Spireites

   [28]Saturday, 13 February 2016 [29]Gabriel

   Burton Albion went eight points clear in the League One promotion race
   on Friday night, as Calum Butcher’s first half strike saw them to a 1-0
   win over Chesterfield. The grand scale of their achievement was perhaps
   not matched with the most memorable performance, yet there were also
   signs of why the Brewers are top of… [30]Read more →

[31]Blackburn v Hull: why Gomez can lift Rovers

   [32]Friday, 12 February 2016 [33]Gabriel

   There has always been one ‘Geordie’ in the hearts of Blackburn Rovers
   fans, and manager Paul Lambert will hope he has signed another. Jordi
   Gomez joins on loan from Sunderland and he is a player who could inject
   some much-needed creativity into this Rovers midfield. At
   Middlesbrough, Lambert changed his system to accommodate Gomez. He
   switched from… [34]Read more →

[35]Doncaster v Sheff Utd: Blades underachieving

   [36]Friday, 12 February 2016 [37]Gabriel

   This blog was sceptical of Sheffield United’s promotion credentials in
   pre-season but not for a moment did anybody think they would be 11th at
   this stage. The main problem appears to be the lack of pace in their
   team. With the large budget Nigel Adkins was afforded in the summer, he
   went for what you might think would be… [38]Read more →

[39]Stanley v Crawley: the importance of bouncebackability

   [40]Thursday, 11 February 2016 [41]Gabriel

   More often than not this season, Crawley Town’s matches are decided by
   the first goal. According to Soccerstats, The Red Devils have won nine
   of the 12 games in which they score the game’s opener, but lost 13 of
   the 16 games in which they concede it. They have kept more clean sheets
   than half the teams… [42]Read more →

[43]Posh pride despite defeat on pens

   [44]Wednesday, 10 February 2016 [45]Gabriel

   It was heartbreak for Peterborough and Lee Angol, who missed the
   penalty that meant his side crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of
   Premier League West Brom. Jon Taylor gave the League One hosts a
   deserved opener early in the second half, but Darren Fletcher’s
   thunderous strike made way for an enthralling… [46]Read more →

[47]The Cobblers View: promotion in sight

   [48]Monday, 8 February 2016 [49]Gabriel

   Over the previous five seasons, the average League Two team has needed
   81 points to secure automatic promotion. Some clubs at this stage might
   start to over-analyse the mathematics, but Northampton need not worry.
   They already have 61 points in early February, and could conceivably
   win promotion if they drew their final 18 games. Manager Chris
   Wilder might not want people… [50]Read more →

[51]Clinical Lions expose Walsall’s defensive deficiencies

   [52]Saturday, 6 February 2016 [53]Gabriel

   Millwall stayed in the League One top six with a 3-0 win at Walsall on
   Saturday afternoon. Without discrediting the Lions after such an
   encouraging result, their victory was down to superior defending and
   clinical finishing, rather than classic attacking play. They adapted to
   the rainy conditions better and exposed Walsall’s lack of defensive
   protection… [54]Read more →

[55]Why Brentford must balance style with substance

   [56]Saturday, 6 February 2016 [57]Gabriel

   The Football Lab has often spoken highly of Dean Smith and has praised
   the talent he and Richard O’Kelly have inherited at Brentford. However,
   there have been certain signs in the last month or so that something is
   not quite right at Griffin Park. That is, not because of the four
   straight defeats in early January – every… [58]Read more →
