We are delighted to welcome you on this great adventure

   We are delighted to welcome you to this great adventure - an Anglican
   church planted from [59]Holy Trinity Brompton in 2009, building a fun
   community in one of the most iconic and recognised buildings in the
   heart of Brighton, with a vision to play our part in the
   re-evangelisation of the nations and the transformation of society.
   Feel free to join us at one of our 5[60] Sunday services.

   If you would like to explore the meaning of life in an informal
   environment, we would love to invite you to join the next [61]Alpha
   course.

   We have [62]Teams which are great places to connect and to see the
   vision of St Peter’s alive in Brighton. During the week we get together
   in [63]Hubs - fortnightly gatherings of anything between 15-25 people,
   for food, friends, teaching, worship and prayer - the ideal way to feel
   like you belong.

   For anything else, please check out the [64]Facebook page, and don't
   hesitate to [65]contact us

   With best wishes - Archie and Sam
