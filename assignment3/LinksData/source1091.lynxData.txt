   started in June 12, 2008 and we grew rather rapidly because of our
   Twitter Counter badge. The button is a nice small image that shows your
   visitors how many followers you have on Twitter. Within a year the
   button was on many many blogs around the world and we displayed more
   than 100 million buttons in one month. We track follower stats for over
   180 million users now.
