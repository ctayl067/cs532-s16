[6]Innovation and Entrepreneurship

   [7]October 23, 2015

   Last night I attended an event organised by Christchurch Connected
   Educators on ‘Innovation and Entrepreneurship’.  The event was held at
   Core Education’s shiny new office space, a showcase of a true Modern
   Learning Environment. Two inspiring speakers, Derek Wenmoth (Director
   of e-Learning at Core) and Lauren Merritt (Director at The Ministry of
   Awesome) talked about education, innovation and entrepreneurship and
   what skills our learners will need for their future.Derek Wenmoth If
   you haven’t had the opportunity to hear Derek Wenmoth speak then you
   must. Derek is a thought leader in education and we are lucky to have
   him right here in Christchurch! Derek reminded us that our education
   system, based on the industrial model, is no longer equipping our young
   people with the skills they need to enter the workforce. He challenged
   us to think about what we must do to prepare our learners for a rapidly
   changing world. What changes as schools and teachers do we need to
   make? […]

[9]The Google Challenge

   [10]October 7, 2015

   Over the couple of months our IT Vision Group at St Margaret’s College
   has gathered student voice on learning with digital technologies. As a
   Digital Learning Facilitator, it was interesting for me to learn that
   many students would like more hands on support in learning how to use
   digital tools in their learning.  We often assume that our students are
    “digital natives” and pick it all up quickly. Our learners have
   indicated in their feedback that this isn’t always the case. As we
   enter Term 4 and think about our planning for 2016 this feedback got me
   thinking about how we can provide more support for our new girls coming
   into school, particularly at Year 9. Being both BYOD and a Google Apps
   for Education school (GAFE) it is important for our learners to be able
   to utilise these tools effectively, as a result I decided to create the
   SMC Google Challenge.  Paul Sibson at Fendalton School has implemented
   a digital badging […]

[12]MakerEd Event

   [13]September 9, 2015

   The Maker Movement is a growing trend in education right now and is an
   area of particular interest to me.  See my blog post – Teaching Kids To
   Code – An Essential Literacy.  The notion of ‘learning by doing’ and
   ensuring our learners are becoming creators, rather than simply
   consumers of technology is a key motivator in embracing the Maker
   Culture in schools. In order to prepare our learners for the changing
   world that they will enter, as educators, we need to provide them with
   opportunities to be; creative, collaborative, problem solvers and risk
   takers.  Our learners need the opportunity to harness new technologies
   and to take part in real world projects both within and beyond the
   school environment. To support Christchurch teachers in this field, a
   community of educators of which I am fortunate to be a member
   - Christchurch Connected Educators organised a successful MakerEd
   Event.  The event was held on the 29th July, 2015 at the stunning new

[15]TechStars Recommend…

   [16]August 13, 2015

   TechStars This year, at St Margaret’s, I have established a group of
   TechStars.  These are Year 9 students that love tech and have really
   hooked into the idea of making “IT geek IT chic”.  They are in the
   process of creating a blog to share “cool IT apps/sites and tips”.  The
   girls are also supporting me with various projects and have recently
   been creating IT help videos, which will be released shortly. I am
   really enjoying working with this fabulous group of girls and it is
   very much a shared learning experience. Recently the girls shared two
   digital tools that they love using – here they are: Wattpad is a
   massive hit!  A must read for the English teachers… Wattpad blurb
   from Crunchbase: Wattpad is the world’s largest community of readers
   and writers. It’s the free and fun way to read on the web and across
   all mobile devices. Everyday millions of people use Wattpad to read
   unique new fiction or share […]

[18]Year 9 Product Design – a new course with new technology

   [19]May 13, 2015

   This year I created our first Product Design Course as one of our Year
   9 Technology rotations and the first module is just coming to an end so
   this is a good opportunity to reflect. This is a very exciting course
   with 3D printers as a new addition to St Margaret’s College. Whilst I
   followed the Technology Curriculum I was  incredibly lucky to have been
   given an open brief, enabling me to taking the learning in the
   direction that would follow the girls’ passions. I surveyed a group of
   Year 8 students at the end of last year to help inform my planning and,
   not surprisingly, discovered that the girls would love to create
   jewellery. I toyed with the idea of having the girls create their own
   brief and design any type of jewellery that appealed to them or, with
   this all being very new, to provide them with a brief and therefore an
   outcome. I opted to go with […]

   Urban Wall Image

[21]Urban Living Wall Launch

   [22]May 12, 2015

   New technology brings new opportunities and with the addition of 3D
   printers to St Margaret’s College, we were extremely lucky to
   participate in a collaborative project between the Department of
   Conservation, the Christchurch City Council, the CHCH FAB LAB, and AUT
   to create an Urban Living Wall for our city.  It is exciting to see
   collaborative, innovative projects such as this one bringing not only
   great environmental benefits to our city as it rebuilds but also peace,
   beauty and tranquility.   It was extra special having one of our old
   girls, Elizabeth Guthery, co ordinating this project.  Elizabeth
   visited St Margaret’s early last term, bringing with her the conceptual
   design of the wall, a roll of white PLA filament and 3D print details.
    We learned that the origins of the designs for the planter panels came
   from Dr Steve Reay’s (Senior Lecturer in the Industrial Design and
   Innovation Department at AUT University, Auckland) inspiration and
   would resemble a rock wall scape.  Our role, along with […]

   Mash Up Pic

[24]An amazing Mash Up

   [25]May 12, 2015

   In my role as a Digital Learning Facilitator at St Margaret’s College,
   I had the great pleasure of taking Year 6 to a “Mash Up” competition
   held at Selwyn House at the end of last term.  I am still not entirely
   sure how to define a “Mash Up” yet but in a nutshell it is an
   opportunity for children to work collaboratively thinking of real world
   problems and ways in which they could be solved using technology. Code
   Club Aotearoa organised the event, bringing in a team of IT industry
   experts for the afternoon to work with 250 students from schools across
   Christchurch.  It was fast, furious and fantastic! The afternoon
   started with an intro from organisers Michael and Tim and an outline of
   what was to come – “an action packed event mixing creativity,
   technology, design, teamwork and quick thinking without a moments
   rest!”  The clock started and the groups (with their IT mentor) began
   the “ideation” stage of […]

[27]Teaching Kids to Code – An Essential Literacy

   [28]March 24, 2015

   Future Schools – Teaching Kids to Code Conference Reflection The key
   messages from the Teaching Kids to Code conference: Get our kids
   creating technology rather than simply using technology.  Let them get
   under the bonnet. Get kids coding from a young age. Provide
   opportunities for our children to learn by doing or making. I was
   privileged to attend the Future Schools – Teaching Kids to Code
   Conference recently in Sydney which was inspiring, challenging and
   affirming. My first takeaway came from Dr Gary Stager who challenges us
   to teach kids to be creators of technology not simply consumers or
   users of it.  This is not a new concept, in fact I was chatting to a
   colleague who shared her experience of using Logo programming to teach
   mathematical concepts in the 70s . The work of Logo creators Seymour
   Papert and Cynthia Solomon had a profound impact on the education
   landscape well before the turn of the century and even today […]

[30]Getting started with Blogger by flipping the learning

   [31]February 28, 2015

   More and more teachers are seeing how they can incorporate blogs into
   their teaching and learning programmes and we have more teachers and
   students utilising blogger than ever before at school. This year I have
   set up individual blogs with my Year 9 Product Design class so that the
   girls can share, celebrate and reflect on their learning. In this
   course the girls will design and produce (3D print) a unique piece of
   jewellery that means something, or tells a story about them. The blog
   will chart their progress following a design process and provide a
   space the students to evaluate their own progress. A blog is a really
   great tool for many purposes and some include: Developing writing,
   providing students with an authentic audience. To share and celebrate
   learning. For students to reflect on their learning, evaluating
   progress towards the completion of a task.  I had the pleasure of
   working with our Year 7 girls last week in setting […]

[33]Fab day at Fabriko!

   [34]December 17, 2014

   The highlight of our recent Technology Faculty day was a visit to
   Fabriko and working with Bridget McKendry (@pixelbrid). Fabriko began
   as The Makercrate, a small shipping container converted into a
   Makerspace for the Christchurch community.  People of all ages have the
   opportunity to get along and get creative with specialist equipment
   such as 3D printers, laser cutters, Arduino kits etc…. Fabriko has
   expanded and now occupies a warehouse on Wilsons Road and the coffee
   shop located at the front is a nice touch!  Fabriko’s mission is to
   “increase digital literacy through design thinking…providing community
   access to new and emerging technology, such as 3D printers and
   Arduino…” Bridget was brilliant, giving us the opportunity to learn
   about and use the Makerbot 3D Printers.  She talked us through
   the functionality of the equipment, the different filaments that can be
   used, trouble shooting and we had a go at printing a product.  I was
   thrilled with my fox ring, although I can’t get it off my daughter […]
