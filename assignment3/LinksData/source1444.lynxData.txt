SOME FACTORS IN TONIGHT'S GAMES:
[13]PENGUINS TRYING TO TURN SEASON AROUND AGAINST [14]HURRICANES

        HURRICANES [15]JORDAN STAAL IS REDHOT BUT I WOULD LOOK TO EITHER
   [16]CROSBY'S TOP LINE OR THE PENS SECOND LINE FOR POINTS TONIGHT.

STATSNEY IS OUT IN THE STL V. NJD GAME.

       WITH STATSNEY OUT [17]LEHTERA (CHEAP PICK UP) WILL BE REUNITED WITH
   [18]TARASENKO ON THE TOP LINE  WITH [19]FABBRI ON THE LEFT WING.
    NEW JERSEY HAS A PRETTY SOLID DEFENSE I DO NOT SEE THAT MAKING A
   DIFFERENCE TONIGHT SEEING THAT KEITH KINKAID IS IN NET.

MINNESOTA V. BUFFALO

        DUBNYK DUBNYK DUBNYK.  IF YOU CAN GET THE DOOB IN NET ON YOUR
   LINEUP TONIGHT WITH DEFENSEMAN SPURGEON OR SUTER.
      VERY INTERESTING MATCH-UP HERE TONIGHT THIRD YEAR IN A ROW THAT 43RD
   GAME FOR MIN HAS BEEN AGAINST BUFFALO MINNESOTA HAS USED THIS 43RD GAME
   TO GET BACK ON TRACK GIVEN BUFFALO'S TRACK RECORD AND CURRENT PLAY IT
   IS SAFE TO LOAD UP ON MIN PLAYERS
   READ MORE ON THIS GAME IT IS COMPELLING[20] CLICKHERE

MAKE OR BREAK FANTASY MATCH-UP
​WPG. V. SJS.

       SJS IS ON A STRETCH PLAYING 3 GAMES IN THE LAST 4 DAYS SEEING AS
   NONE OF THEIR KEY PLAYERS ARE CHEAP PICKING THE RIGHT GUYS ON WPG IS
   KEY. IF THE JETS BREAK OUT AND YOU HAVE THEIR SCORERS ON YOUR TEAM YOU
   WILL BE IN GOOD SHAPE IF NOT WELL DON'T BE DISJOINTED ITS THE JETS.

CRAWFORD IN NET AT HOME AGAINST NASHVILLE
​NASHVILLE DOESNT HAVE A STAR DEFENSEMAN ON THEIR SECOND PAIRING

      OPEN UP THE NUMBERS HAWKS HAVEN'T BEEN LETTING MANY GOALS IN AT HOME
   BUT THE CROW IS PRONE TO LETTING IN A FEW FROM TIME TO TIME AND
   JOHANSEN KNOWS HOW TO SCORE ON CRAWFORD. FURTHERMORE IT IS HOSSA'S
   BIRTHDAY SO THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE B DAY GOAL.
        JONES NO LONGER ON NASHVILLE IS THE SECOND LINE FOR THE HAWKS
   GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IF YOU THINK SO DIAL IN ANISIMOV, KANE,
   PANARIN.
         NASHVILLE COULD RUN WITH THIS THE MATCH-UPS BETWEEN THE TW #19S
   TOEWS VS. JOHANSEN ARE ALWAYS GREAT LOOK FOR SOME ACTION OUT OF
   NASHVILLES TOP LINE.

​HEAVY ON ARIZONA

   BOEDKER, DOMI, VERMETTE. OILERS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING SO THIS COULD BE A
   SAFE BET AND FREE UP CAP SPACE.

Look For High Scores in Sharks VS. Flames & Bruins VS. Rangers

Chris Kreider is returning to the ice after his injury and Brad Marchard will
be back after his suspension.

LA KINGS VS. REDWINGS Go to THE PowerPlay LINES and keep in mind LA has a
good defense

[33]Florida Panthers​​ Streak? Will it continue? Tough call Florida's
defensive play in their away games has been very solid however looking at the
[34]Canucks Scoring capability I think the panthers know playing in their end
is not the way to go tonight. If Florida wants to continue their streak they
are going to try to break open the scoring early and keep applying the
offensive pressure.

Here Are The Picks For me tonight.on [35]DraftKings

   C : [36]V. Lecavalier LA $2,500
   C : [37]A. Barkov Fla $5,800
   W: [38]J. Huberdeau Fla$5,500

Lets Go Streaking

        First things first lets address the obvious, two teams are on win
   streaks and will be looking to raise their winning tides while climbing
   in the NHL rankings.  First we have the Colorado Avalanche meeting up
   with the Blackhawks in Chicago,  Secondly the Florida Panthers will be
   headed to Edmonton to face the Oilers looking to extend their streak to
   12 wins in a row.
        The Blackhawks have had trouble with the Avalanche in this season
   finally beating them this season in their last outing If your going to
   go Chicago I would revert back to the #2 Line for some Goals
   [50]KANE,[51] ANISIMOV[52], [53]PANARIN[54],[55]SEABROOK  (all four are
   also on the top PP line.) As Long as Crawford Doesn't spring a leak
   tonight the Hawks should continue their streak .
       Panthers VS. Oilers....... I am excited for this one I see no
   Reason for the Panthers to not emerge victorious aside from it being an
   away game(this is the lasty game of the night so if you want to sneak
   in last minute points.). The oilers are looking to bounce back after
   an embarrassing outing against the lightning I think the Panthers are
   going to exploit that. I am going to split line 1 & 3 for the panthers
   Taking Jagr and Jokinen if your looking for a cheap goalie you might
   want to consider  Montoya who is in net tonight for Florida

LOOK FOR HIGH SCORING GAME BETWEEN THE [59]NEW YORK RANGERS AND THE
[60]WASHINGTON CAPITALS

     USING THE DAILYFACEOFF.COM THIS MORNING? READ UP ON THE 2 GOAL
   TENDERRS RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THIS SCREEN CONCERNING THEIR LAST 2 GAMES
   AGAINST EACH OTHER.([61]CLICKHERE) BOTH [62]HOLTBY AND [63]LUNQUIST
   HAVE GIVEN UP  CLOSE TO 4 GOALS IN EACH OF THEIR LAST TWO OUTINGS SO
   KEEP THAT IN MIND.

GOTTA RUN

      I AM SHORT ON TIME THIS MORNING SO I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK INTO
   EACH GAME  JUST STAY AWAY FROM HOLTBY AND LUNQUIST TODAY. [64]SAN JOSE
   HAS A DECENT MATH UP AGAINST TORONTO BUT TORONTO HAS A LITTLE WIND
   UNDER THEIR LEAF AND MIGHT BE PULLING OFF AN UPSET.
         PICKING UP [65]RYAN SUTER TONIGHT JUST ON A HUNCH HE IS A
   DEFENSEMAN WITH A LOT OF ASSISTS AND A LEADER IN THE HOCKEY WORLD ON
   AND OFF THE ICE I THINK HIS LINE WILL STEP UP THE GAME AS THEY GO
   AGAINST THE [66]DALLAS STARS TONIGHT.

SHOULD YOU PICK JOHANSEN OR JONES IN TONIGHT'S GAMES?


   I expect the percentage of people picking Johansen and Jones tonight to
   be high on draftkings and other fantasy platforms so if you want to
   avoid them and they come up with nothing that could be another way to
   go in tonights games.
             I offer advice for daily hockey leagues typically
   [70]DRAFTKINGS and FANDUEL, it comes to these daily leagues there IS a
   little wiggle room when trying to get lucky. Therefore I will say yes
   to Johansen tonight for a daily fantasy draft pick ($5'600 on draft
   kings.) and per usual I will be leaving Seth Jones out of my line up.
   If you are in a year round league I would hold off on trading up for
   either of these players for now.
     __________________________________________________________________

CENTERS TO START IN TONIGHT'S GAMES

   [71]RYAN JOHANSEN against all other analyst's advice I have seen today
    he has proved to be a fantasy weapon in the past he will be on the top
   line for the Preds with Colin Wilson and James Neal along side him.
       Look for the top line in Chicago to pot a goal or two tonight[72]
   Johnathan Toews will have Shaw's net presence tonight if he can get
   under Chad Johnson's skin the puck is going in .
       You may also want to Give [73]_[74]Jori Lehtera[75]_ a Look in
   tonights match-up.
   ​

Wingers To Start In Tonight's Games

         As I mentioned above Th Black Hawks top line should be looking
   good tonight [76]Andrew Shaw Or [77]Marian Hossa could work out nicely
   (Shaw is $3,600 on [78]DRAFTKINGS)
         Now that that is out of the way, lets continue. St. Louis Blues
   #2 Line [79]_[80]Tarasenko is back on it with Lehtera under center if
   you can afford it pick him up if not Fabbri is on the other side.
       More notables Wingers in tonight's  games [81]Nikita
   Kucherov and[82] James Neal

DefenseMen

   [83]Roman Josi and [84]Shea Weber hardly ever dissapoint you may also
   consider[85] Shattenkirk or [86]Victor Hedman

Goalies to Start In tonight's Game

   [87]Corey Crawford is Playing at home against Buffalo either hes
   letting very few in the net or quite a few he is also coming off rest
   seeing that Darling was in net the last Game. Down side is he will take
   up a lot of salary cap. If your looking for a cheaper Goalie [88]Cam
   Ward Has the go ahead and should do pretty good tonight.

   of getting things going but would like to share some of my picks

Trades To Keep In mind

         Leclavalier, Luke Schenn, and Weal Will not accrue points tonight
   on Draft Kings so keep that in mind.  Seth Jones was also traded to
   Columbus for Ryan Johansen since neither team is playing tonight this
   will not effect any decisions.

GO Heavy ON LA
​

   -LA Has the Prime Match-up and they have been playing pretty good
   lately
   -Keep in mind that the panthers are hot they have some low cap play
   cough cough (Trochek)(Jokinen)
   and Ottawa has had some less than great goal tending.
   C-MIKAEL GRANLUND ​ Granlund, who put up 1 goal and 2 assists in his
   last game only has 4 goals this season I think he will be on the point
   sheet tonight against Philadelphia don't quote me on it but he has a
   pretty good matchup  and for $4300 on [99]DraftKings he will be saving
   some cap space.( I'm banking on MINNESOTA # 2 Line.)
   W- Tyler Toffoli We all know what he can do when he is on and he has
   been putting up good numbers lately, the match up is looking promising
   and for any fantasy hockey enthusiast this could be a no brainier.
   D- Defense-men are usually up in the air for me the obvious choices are
   players like Brent Burns, and Drew Doughty, but for salary cap sake I
   am going to say  ALEC MARTINEZ I will be going with doughty because he
   and Tofolli are on the same line If you want to stay away from LA go
   with Braun or Vlasic from the San Jose Sharks
   Goalie: Johnny Quick Again Great Match-up so its Kings all the way if
   Luongo gets the nod he may be worth a shot but against a big team
   like Winnipeg its hard to call
