Welcome

   St Catherine's College conferences

   St Catherine's is Oxford's youngest undergraduate college and we bring
   a fresh, contemporary feel to the Oxford conference experience - 800
   years of University history cast in a modern mould.

   During College vacations we can offer you the perfect venue for
   residential conferences of up to 250 delegates (using one main lecture
   space). Our dedicated conference spaces also welcome training days, day
   conferences and meetings/events for up to 80 daytime participants
   during term time.

   Our buildings and facilities provide a wonderful combination for any
   event. They include:

   [10]*[11]  Purpose-built and varied lecture theatres, seminar rooms and
   office

   [12]    space complete with audio visual equipment;

   [13]*  Circa 250 purpose-built, modern ensuite bedrooms during
   vacations;

   [14]*  The largest dining hall of the Oxford Colleges - Grade 1 Listed,

       [15]designed by Arne Jacobsen and seating up to 380 guests;

   [16]*  In-house kitchen and waiting teams who pride themselves on
   fresh, high
       quality food and exceptional service.


   If you have already booked an event with us, you might like to refer
   your delegates to this website (and the [17]College sister site) so
   that they can familiarise themselves with the College & facilities
   before they arrive.
