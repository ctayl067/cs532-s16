   Hi David, We saw you at crop over in Barbados in 1988. I am writing a
   book which includes a chapter on bananas in the windwards. May I have
   your kind permission to quote from your song .. Well uncle Sammy used
   to visit the Church of Banana He used to go to church with a girl named
   Grenada He used to bow down to one St Vincent Then he used to go and
   pray to one called St Lucia He say he loved the way they preached in
   the Caribbean chapter But one day Uncle Sammy he went South America And
   he bounced up a girl she name was Chiquita Chiquita Dole is her name
   and she got plenty power Then West Indian girls get vexed and the whole
   thing turned sour I was working for the European Commission at the time
   and we were trying to help the Windwards smallholders, while the
   Americans were against the special trade arrangements for the
   Caribbean. Most grateful for your permission. Many thanks and best
   regards, George Gwyer

   Hey Mr. Rudder, I'm a student of A.B.C.C. and I'm participating in the
   Drama Film Festival for This Year. I am requesting your permission to
   use one of your songs, which is "Trini 2 de bone." for a play which I
   wrote. My colleagues and decided to use this song because it was very
   inspirational for us to place this song in our play. It also matched
   the topic so we await your response, Yours Sincerely, Nan Je Ye.

   My review of "Random Notes":
   http://www.afropop.org/explore/album_review/ID/4331 Legend has it that
   as Philosopher-Poet Lao Tzu was leaving the Royal City after the
   kingdom he served had fallen into decadence, a city guard requested
   that he sit and write out a record of his wisdom before heading into
   exile. It may be a quirky comparison but David Rudder’s Random Notes is
   truly a legacy recording from a similarly large mind....
