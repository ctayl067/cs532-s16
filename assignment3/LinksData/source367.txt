		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just last month, I created a <a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/new-viral-app-stolen/">few articles </a>centred around the globally successful and vitally-addictive Apple &#8216;game'(?) &#8216;Stolen&#8217;, a game where you compete with other real world users to purchase desired Twitter accounts like trading cards.</p>
<p>I was hooked, and so too were tens of thousands of users. Hundreds of thousands wanted to get in to this exclusive game, but couldn&#8217;t due to its strict and hard &#8216;get-in&#8217; feature of codes.</p>
<p>When I finally got in, I was greeted by a very fast, very fun game. Little did I know the controversy building up around it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, backlash came in thick and fast. Despite it having some super-power &#8216;celebrity&#8217; backing (many notable accounts played the game) the developers were inundated with hateful messages and even a cease-and-dismiss from a disgruntled congresswoman. Chen, the creator of the App, <a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.wordpress.com/2016/01/14/social-app-stolen-shuts-down/">suddenly deleted the App entirely,</a> much to the shock of tens of thousands of fans.</p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_8051.png"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_8051.png?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My profile as seen on the now-deleted App. RIP.</p></div>&nbsp;<br />
Early in Stolen’s short little inception, Zoe Quinn &#8211; the original target of GamerGate, had sent the company a rather blunt and brutally sharp note demanding her profile to be removed from the game. Chen hastily complied, but Quinn’s statement to Chen that morning was not demeaning in its aim. Instead, noticing the immense backlash aimed at Chen by ex-Stolen players, she offered her professional assistance and support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a segment for The Verge, Casey Newton quotes her as saying,&#8221;I know how nasty backlash can be on the internet,&#8221; Quinn says. &#8220;I just reached out — I was like, ‘hey, I hope you guys are all right. I know you got a lot of backlash. If stuff gets scary or anything, I do run an anti-harassment organization. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.’&#8221;</p>
<p>This led to today&#8217;s recreation of the iOS&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/famous!-be-biggest-fan-your/id1078780048?ls=1&amp;mt=8">App</a>, this time called &#8216;Famous&#8217; and offering a lot less controversy.</p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_8050.png"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_8050.png?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My profile as seen on the new App.</p></div>&nbsp;<br />
Rather than using currency to purchase users, it uses &#8216;fame&#8217; symbolised by hearts. Rather than owning someone, you become &#8216;their biggest fan&#8217;. It&#8217;s language that is severely toned down from the original game, much to the support of both Quinn and likely many past sceptics.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be amongst the first to receive a download code for it, given exclusively by an individual so that I could write this report. The game itself, at the moment at least, is much slower and frankly more &#8216;dead&#8217; than the original, namely due to the lack of verified accounts which were the most sought-after accounts in the past. Instead, I&#8217;m met by a wall of &#8216;nobodies&#8217;, people I don&#8217;t know and have no intention of buying.</p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_8052.png"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_8052.png?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A wall of completely random accounts and one verified.</p></div>&nbsp;<br />
There is no chat feature, namely due to the backlash this may cause Chen, and there&#8217;s no way to directly interact with one another.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope this game picks up pace, and verified accounts start getting added, otherwise sadly this game will join its predecessor in App market heaven. I loved the original, so Chen, please don&#8217;t let this happen!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently, global media reported that the FBI had requested the assistance of Apple (yes, the global technology super-giant) in gaining access to deceased terrorist Syed Farook&#8217;s iPhone.</p>
<p>Basically, after iOS8 was released, photographs, messages and other media became encrypted behind the iPhone&#8217;s passcode (either a 4 or 6 digit numerical password) and Farook had this. &#8216;Luckily&#8217;, his only contained 4 digits, however this leads to 10,000 possible combinations.</p>
<p>The iPhone deletes all data after 10 incorrect guesses.</p>
<p>This has led to a nightmare for the FBI, being unable to attempt to unlock it incase &#8216;vital&#8217; information is lost. This is why they have asked for Apple to provide assistance in unlocking the phone, or in the least, making it possible to use &#8220;brute force&#8217; on the password by disabling the &#8216;swipe data&#8217; feature &#8211; a process of guessing the password over and over until correct.</p>
<p>The FBI has asked Apple to do two things.</p>
<p>Firstly, it wants the company to alter Farook&#8217;s iPhone so that investigators can make unlimited attempts at the passcode without the risk of erasing the data.</p>
<p>Secondly, it wants Apple to help implement a way to rapidly try different passcode combinations, to save tapping in each one manually.</p>
<p>As expected, especially since the post-Snowden world, Apple responded negatively towards this, <a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">releasing a statement on the Apple website</a> minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some key points made in the statement:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>We were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino last December. We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government’s efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good</i>. <i>Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The statement then seemingly provides a clear &#8220;back-off&#8221; directive, labelling it as a &#8220;back door&#8221; and having the potential for further use outside of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: <b>Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor</b>. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The open letter then closes with the following line:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We are challenging the FBI&#8217;s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The statement was then concluded simply by &#8220;Tim Cook&#8221;, Chief Executive of Apple, connoting the extremely serious and socially prominent argument this issue raises.</p>
<p>Do you think Apple should create a &#8216;back door&#8217; for the FBI to use and potentially use outside this case, or do you think this would be abused and add to the &#8216;security state&#8217;? Let me know in the comments below or on <a href="https://twitter.com/goldennike11">Twitter</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As posted earlier today on <a href="https://twitter.com/martinshkreli/status/697897324329177088">Twitter</a>, Martin Shkreli has offered to buy the new and upcoming Kanye West album, &#8216;The Life of Pablo&#8217;.</p>
<p>Shkreli became infamous during late 2015 for <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymullin/2015/12/21/turing-pharma-says-daraprim-availability-will-be-unaffected-by-shkreli-arrest/#1a9d693d2e82">raising the price of the antiparasitic drug &#8216;Daraprim&#8217;</a> by 5556% to $750 per tablet (up from only $13.50). This saw thousands of vulnerable people unable to afford the drugs new price, and as a result, be labelled &#8220;The Most Hated Man in America&#8221;.</p>
<p>The controversial founder/ former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals has now reached out to Yeezy through Twitter and offered to buy the rights to the album, preventing it being made available to the public. The current offer stands at a value of $10,000,000 (ten million dollars) with the line &#8220;I believe you will find this financial arrangement more attractive than your current course of action.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7823.png"><img src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7823.png?w=676" alt=""></a>&nbsp;<br />
The &#8216;letter&#8217; itself seems unprofessional and rushed, with it not even containing a signature and a cursor mark still following the full-stop after &#8220;DM&#8221;. The fact he also offered to be contacted through DM, and made the letter open straight away, further fuels the notion that Martin Shkreli is seeking another ego-boost so soon after his <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/04/martin-shkreli-congressional-testimony-turing-pharmaceuticals-valeant-fda-drug-prices/79808004/">hearing in front of Congress</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Kanye has yet to respond, but <a href="https://twitter.com/martinshkreli/status/698053561213710336">Shkreli followed up</a> on Twitter with, &#8220;Why does @Twitter have a DM limit? Kanye could have accepted or countered me and I have no idea. Help!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, this comes following the &#8220;bad boy of big pharma&#8217;s&#8221; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album/">complete purchase of the Wu-Tang Clan&#8217;s 2015 album</a> &#8216;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin&#8217; for $2,000,000 (two million dollars). This was met with huge controversy and global criticism from both music critics and fans of the band, and only two days prior to this articles creation, it was announced that Shkreli <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0VI1KO">would be sued</a> over his ownership of this album due to an artists dispute.</p>
<p>It is unlikely West will follow up on the offer by Shkreli, however as seen before, Kanye can be unpredictable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>$10 million dollars is a lot of money. Would you sell such a sought-after album to such a hated man?</p>

		<p><em>Drugs have long been a part of everyday culture; from celebrity scandals to national talk shows, drugs are universally understood as negative and scary things. Recently, one of the most dangerous drugs has gained popularity on the social media platform ‘Tumblr’. Specific fan pages and pages endorsing its usage have been created, posting&nbsp;the owners drug possessions, and in many cases, videos and photos of themselves injecting heroin. There are also ‘smaller’ pages that use the hashtag ‘#heroin’ to connect with other ‘users’ in the world – a community of addicts and recovering souls.</em><br />
<em>In the following series, I will talk to some of the largest names on Tumblr that openly post their tales and images of heroin usage and to better understand their world.</em></p>
<p>In part 4, I talked to ‘Yoshi’, a young man&nbsp;who has struggled with heroin usage for 6 years. He&nbsp;talked to me of the mental problems heroin gave him, issues with sleep paralysis and his&nbsp;advice for young people considering&nbsp;using heroin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7774.jpg"><img class="size-custom" title="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7774.jpg?w=750&#038;h=1334" alt="" width="750" height="1334"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8216;Yoshi&#8217;s&#8217; Tumblr timeline.</p></div><strong>To get right into it, how long have you been using heroin?</strong></p>
<p>I have been using heroin, on and off, since I was 15. I&#8217;m 21 now.</p>
<p><strong>So 6 years? Has your body had any noticeable negative effects as a result?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s more mental damage than anything. It was a time that I started to use heavy, I&#8217;m talking about maybe a half a gram a day, I started to develop sleep paralysis and it’s not a ‘once in a blue moon’ thing, it happens every night now.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain your experiences with sleep paralysis?</strong></p>
<p>*Ummm* well, whenever you have sleep paralysis, you think that you’re awake whilst your body is still sleeping. I can basically wake up and move my eyes, but my body feels like someone heavy is standing on top of me. You can&#8217;t breathe, or it feels as if someone is sucking your breath away. And sometimes, I see figures that my mind has made up in the shadows of my room; sometimes, I see demonic presences or a creature, etc. It&#8217;s crazy what your mind can do.</p>
<p><strong>And you think that’s a direct result of your heroin usage?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, because it all started happening after I started to use heavy. It might affect people differently, but for me, I can 100% say that at some point, a chemical imbalance went off in my brain after I started using heroine heavy.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously, heroin is a very dangerous drug. Do you ever think of the dangers when using, or is that usually an after-thought?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Every time, but as soon as it hits my blood stream, all that is out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever had any severe reactions/ medical emergencies due to heroin?</strong></p>
<p>No, I stay away from bad heroine by either testing the purity and seeing what it is cut with first, and I never share syringes. I&#8217;m not the type to think I can&#8217;t overdose, so if it&#8217;s a new batch, I do the smallest amount possible first. So no, heroine has never put me in the hospital or caused me any harm really.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s &#8216;good&#8217; to hear. Now, heroin is very much stigmatised in the media. Do you ever feel there isn&#8217;t enough support for the issue, if you want it?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, because kids these days don&#8217;t really know that this shit is not a game. I honestly believe that if heroin was showed to me at a younger age &#8211; for what it really is, I wouldn&#8217;t have touched the shit. No one really can tell you that heroine is not something that you ‘try once and never touch again’. It&#8217;s something that even the love of God can&#8217;t match. There is no drug on this earth that matches heroin. So, yeah, stop making weed seem so evil and tell these kids what the real shit will do to you.</p>
<p><strong>So I found you through the hashtag &#8216;#heroin&#8217;. How come you openly tagged content with this?</strong></p>
<p>Because other people that have the same addiction contact me just like how you did and talk about addiction and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like it promotes heroin use, or creates a community?</strong></p>
<p>Both. Some people like showing off, but I do it for the community.</p>
<p><strong>Are you ever worried a child or other vulnerable person, like a recovering addict may see your content?</strong></p>
<p>*Hmmm* Yeah, I guess, but I&#8217;m not here to promote drugs ‘really’. I hope that their ‘at home’ life is positive, to where they don&#8217;t fall into addiction.</p>
<p><strong>But surely content like that may drive them to be curious/ think of it as glamorous?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, maybe, but like I said, their at home situation and the people around them should handle how they do, not my pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Fair enough. How do you feel about yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I feel good about myself. I haven&#8217;t let my addiction take over my love life, work, etc. but I know if I take it too far, it can lead me down a dark road.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you&#8217;ll go &#8216;too far&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know what the future might bring, but I have a strong girlfriend and family to keep me going off the deep end.</p>
<p><strong>What triggered you to use heroin in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>The wrong environment. Just people that were around me got me into it.</p>
<p><strong>So it was peer pressure that got you to try it in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Would you class yourself as an addict?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, sure would. Not proud of it, but I&#8217;m not one of those people that to try to act like they’re not because once you fool yourself to thinking you are not, you start to do more and more.</p>
<p>But we as humans are creatures of habit, so we all are addicted to something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This question might be tough, but do you want to do heroin?</strong></p>
<p>Like now? No, I&#8217;m around my family and friends, so I&#8217;m just chilling. I only do heroin when I&#8217;m by myself, really.</p>
<p><strong>No, I mean in general. Would you like to just never do heroin again?</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah. I would. Shit, I wish I never touched it in the first place. That drug reminds me of the story in the bible of the forbidden fruit, that shit should never be touched at all, but once you touch it, you&#8217;re committed to it. One day I&#8217;ll stop, though.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like your heroin use could affect your chances of getting a career?</strong></p>
<p>*Ummm* Depends what you do. I&#8217;m a producer and work in the music industry, so it&#8217;s not frowned upon as much, but if you’re a white collar worker, then yes, very much so.</p>
<p><strong>Ah I see. What&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d offer to a young person considering using heroin for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t do it, choose something more constructive to do with your time. Drugs are not cool and there’s nothing good that&#8217;s going to come of it.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any reason you don&#8217;t apply that to yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I do, I say it all the time to myself, but it&#8217;s an uphill battle. But, like I said, it&#8217;s like once you have touched this crap it&#8217;s very hard to put it down.</p>
<p><strong>Good luck man. Thank you for speaking with me.</strong></p>
<p>No problem.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATE 2nd Feb 2016 &#8211; The Fine Bros have released an official statement on their &#8216;reaction&#8217; (get it?) stating that they will &#8220;Recind all[&#8230;]&#8217;React&#8217; trademarks&#8221;, including &#8216;Kids React&#8217;. They also promised to discontinue the wildly controversial &#8216;React World&#8217; and finally, to reverse any active copyright claims on YouTube. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of their statement, published <a href="https://medium.com/@FineBrothersEnt/a-message-from-the-fine-brothers-a18ef9b31777#.sfek4gc87">HERE</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7418.png"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7418.png?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Backtreading their 200k+ subscriber loss.</p></div><br />
&nbsp;&#8216;The Fine Bros&#8217; were up until recently, one of the most respected channels on YouTube. They were gods of the video platform, amongst the likes of PewDiePie, Syndicate and countless more; providing entertaining and &#8216;new&#8217; video content.</p>
<p>However, that isn&#8217;t true. The &#8216;kids react&#8217; or &#8216;elders react&#8217; concept has been around much longer than The Fine Bros professionally-produced versions. In fact, there was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120406235634/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99bwWcZ2Eg8&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en#">an entire channel</a> dedicated to &#8216;seniors react&#8217; <i>weeks </i>before &#8216;Elders React&#8217; came about, only to be taken down by The Fine Bros for copyright infringements. Recently, their power-hungry tirade has targeted internet giants such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/43e6a9/link_inside_in_2014_the_fine_bros_told_its/">The Ellen Show</a> (yes, the one with 50+ million followers on Twitter) and <a href="https://twitter.com/thefinebros/status/572989392672837633">Buzzfeed</a> (yes, the annoyingly popular Facebook page)</p>
<p>If this isn&#8217;t enough, The Fine Bros want to create a network known as the React World. If so, any and all &#8216;react&#8217; videos will fall under their property, allowing them to claim ownership or effectively force the owner to delete their hard-work content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further on an earlier point, The Fine Bros utilised their fan base &#8211; a demographic of typically young viewers, to try and target The Ellen Show. They basically created a little Cub Scouts group of hatred, only for it to backlash hard.</p>
<p><div style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7358.png"><img width="720" height="1280" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7358.png?w=720&#038;h=1280" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Fine Bros encouraging the harrassment of The Ellen Show&#8217;s Facebook page.</p></div>&nbsp;<br />
As a result of this, The Fine Bros have seen a MASSIVE decrease in viewers. Actually, their subscriber number has continually fallen, and is now below 14 million; effectively, they&#8217;ve commit social suicide. To prove a point, here&#8217;s their view count right now (as I type this):&nbsp;<div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7356.png"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7356.png?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Fine Bros subsvriber count as of 00:39 Mon 1st Feb 2015.</p></div>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s so bad? They still have millions of followers right?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;yeah, but they&#8217;re scared. The Fine Bros have about 40 employees working for them, mainly funded through the channel&#8217;s sponsors, NOT YouTube monetisation. Whilst this does suck for them, when they do get sponsors, they get a <i>lot</i>&nbsp;of cash; recently they signed a deal with Disney for Star Wars content. The bad side is to come, though. With all this negativity and the outstandingly fast decline in subscribers, I can almost guarantee sponsors will drop off. We&#8217;ve seen it in almost every other situation in the world &#8211; from <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/25/adidas-to-cut-short-iaaf-sponsor-deal-reports.html">sporting</a> to professional gaming, sponsors don&#8217;t want controversy. What have The Fine Bros gone and done? Created arguably the biggest controversy of 2016 in YouTube so far. Without sponsorships, they pretty much have to lay off workers and decrease the size of their &#8216;wonderful&#8217; and dominatrix business. What a shame for &#8216;little guys&#8217;, right?!</p>
<p>On top of the potential loss of sponsors, they are likely to lose their television show &#8216;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4566242/">Six Degrees of Everything</a>&#8216;, as they used to wipe their Facebook page of ANY form of criticism or &#8216;hard&#8217; question. Since the drop in subscribers, this cleansing of comments has decreased in momentum, perhaps a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>Recently, they released an ominously serious titled video on YouTube called &#8216;Update.&#8217;, how fun-sounding! In it, they back-tracked literally everything, admitting to &#8220;screwing up&#8221;, amongst many things, whilst desperately trying to claw back the crumbling body of their brainchild which is gradually gaining momentum in its decay into the &#8216;RIP hall of shame for YouTube&#8217;. Here&#8217;s a fun screenshot of the duo speaking in the video (it literally doesn&#8217;t get more cheerful than this, don&#8217;t get your hopes up&#8230;)</p>
<p>Take note of the beautiful like/dislike ratio&#8230;hmm.</p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7357.png"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7357.png?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Fine Bros looking jolly and friendly.</p></div><br />
In conclusion, The Fine Bros are dying. I mean, the duo are probably alive and well with their millions of dollars in valuation, but their little &#8216;creation&#8217; cruelly stolen and prevented from the grasps of small YouTube channels is dying. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s already dead due to the outstanding number of subscriber loss and dislikes, ontop of social media criticism, but they&#8217;ve still got a little bit of light in them, or at least enough to continually shut down small channels for creating &#8216;react&#8217; content.<i> Like you can copyright a human behaviour</i>.&nbsp;<br />
Anyway, here&#8217;s what their subscriber number is at now:&nbsp;</p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7359.png"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7359.png?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">lmao</p></div><br />
Damn, about -4000 subscribers in a few minutes.<br />
UPDATE &#8211; in just 24 hours, they have lost 54,000+ subscribers, and the numbers are increasing largely.&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7363.png"><img width="828" height="538" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_7363.png?w=828&#038;h=538" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figures for 31st Jan 2016.</p></div>
<p>As ever, I always respect content creators. Hell, The Fine Bros create some of the funniest and best-produced videos on YouTube, but I will always defend the &#8216;up and coming&#8217; stars, the &#8216;new guys&#8217; fighting to get a chance&#8230;not some multi-million dollar company that aims to tear these channels down.</p>

		<p>The setting was ironically pretty perfect; I’m not going to lie. The sand between my toes was no longer an annoyance glued to my sweat but instead tiny granular micro-cushions providing me with unparalleled comfort given the situation. The moon bounced off the crystalline water just right, creating an effect no fresh diamond ever could. It was the greatest beauty the world could replicate, only second to the girl stood before me. The silver shimmers bounced side-to-side upon her bitter-cold cheeks, radiating her smirk with such sublime subtleness. I could but smile at her, yet she smiled through me. I was nothing but a glass pane beaming the world behind me, and she was nothing but looking through me.</p>
<p>Our love was a fallacy, a façade cruelly concocted by her devious mind. I was a placeholder, the missing jigsaw piece for her fulfilment. I was temporary. Expendable. She was not.</p>
<p>She was life summarised in a physical body. She was the gradient of emotions a man can feel; for she was the beaming pride of the morning sun kisses and she was the eye of a devastating storm. She was the force that tore me apart from the inside out, yet still beckoned a smile that screamed wholesome innocence. She was the serpentine creature fuelling me with lustful sin, wrath, pride and envy, yet she was an angel. She was nature and I a mere wandering pollen wholly vulnerable to her power.</p>
<p>Her eyes looked through me, as though I was nothing. I was nothing. Not anymore. The world can be a cruel place when you learn of its selfishness. It can be a lonely place in the most crowded of places and the cruellest creation in the nicest of times.</p>
<p>If God made man in his image, Hell made her.</p>

		<p><em>Drugs have long been a part of everyday culture; from celebrity scandals to national talk shows, drugs are universally understood as negative and scary things. Recently, one of the most dangerous drugs has gained popularity on the social media platform ‘Tumblr’. Specific fan pages and pages endorsing its usage have been created, posting&nbsp;the owners drug possessions, and in many cases, videos and photos of themselves injecting heroin. There are also ‘smaller’ pages that use the hashtag ‘#heroin’ to connect with other ‘users’ in the world – a community of addicts and recovering souls.</em></p>
<p><em>In the following series, I will talk to some of the largest names on Tumblr that openly post their tales and images of heroin usage and to better understand their world.</em></p>
<p>In part 3, I talked to ‘Jess’, a young female who has fought&nbsp;with heroin usage for just under 2 years. She spoke in a humbling, informative tone and talked to me of peer pressure, her mother walking in on her injecting&nbsp;and a direct message to those planning on using heroin for the first time.</p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, how long have you been using heroin?</strong></p>
<p>The first time I used heroin was June of 2014, so it&#8217;ll be 2 years in a few months.</p>
<p><strong>And what would you say was the trigger for your heroin usage?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I’m not really sure. To be completely honest, I’m one of the ‘rare’ heroin addicts. I didn’t start on pain pills, my parents never abused me, I had a really good life, you know? It was just offered one day and I sort of just said “yeah”.</p>
<p><strong>So it was a peer pressure type of thing that got you into using?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not going to blame anyone, because I take full responsibility for my actions, but I suppose so. One of my friends had bought some after he was actually coming up to a year sober and I ended up doing it with him. It’s not like he stuck a needle in my arm and made me get high. But if I had never been with him that day, I’m not sure my life would nearly be the same as it is today.</p>
<p><strong>I get you. Do you regret taking the heroin from him?</strong></p>
<p>That’s such a vague question, I feel. Do I wish I could go back and not be a heroin junkie? Yes, 100%. But, at the same time, I’ve learned a lot from the experiences I’ve had during this two year ‘run’.</p>
<p><strong>What would you say are some of the most important things you&#8217;ve &#8220;learned&#8221; from your experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Well, firstly, I really appreciate my family now. Before, I took them all for granted, but now that they are still by my side through this, it makes me really appreciate what I’ve got. A lot of addicts can’t say the same about their family so I’m truly blessed. Another thing I’ve learned is just how precious life really is, you know? After my own experiences with over dosing and after losing so many friends to this addiction, my outlook has just really changed.</p>
<p><strong>Despite you losing friends to this addiction, you still inject?</strong></p>
<p>As messed up as it is, yes, I still inject.</p>
<p><strong>Are you worried you may end up the same way?</strong></p>
<p>I actually never, ever ‘sniffed’ it. I really jumped the gun and dove right in. Right now, I think majorly due to the fact that I am still in my active addiction, I like to think &#8220;that won’t be me&#8221; or that the paramedics will always bring me back if that was me, you know? My family is more worried about be me than I am.</p>
<p><strong>How did your family find out about your heroin usage?</strong></p>
<p>I actually did a pretty decent job at hiding if for a good amount of time. Almost 6 months, I’d say. She [mother] initially had thoughts I was using, because of all the bruises on my arms and all the track marks, but she confirmed it when she walked in on me shooting up one day.</p>
<p><strong>And what was that experience like?</strong></p>
<p>For her? heart-breaking, I’m sure. For me, i don’t know. I felt a lot of guilt and shame initially, but you end up just getting high so you don’t think about it.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that you successful bid it for 6 months. Was this a stressful time, perhaps even a paranoid time?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, definitely. When you start using, you’re really good at hiding your stuff, or shooting up in places that wouldn’t be obvious. But as time goes on, you get sloppy with it. Those veins that used to work in your hidden spots stop working and you have to use places that are a bit more obvious. Like now a days, it’s to the point where everyone knows I’m a junkie now, I don’t even hide my stuff anymore, as fucked up as that sounds, excuse my language!</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t worry about the language! Do you feel like people negatively judge you due to your heroin use?</strong></p>
<p>100%. People see my track marks in public and instantly judge me. I’m not a bad person, you know? I’m a good person who’s just made some bad choices and is now struggling with it. It sucks sometimes; people hear the word ‘heroin’ and this picture of a homeless person living under a bridge in the city pops in their head. Like no, I grew up in a nice neighbourhood in the suburbs. I got good grades, I played sports all my life, and I was just like their kids! I just made some poor decisions that put me on a different track than their children. That’s the only difference.</p>
<p><strong>By saying that you&#8217;re &#8220;struggling&#8221; with it, do you mean you&#8217;re addicted?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I’m definitely addicted. I’ve tried to stop. I’ve tried to stop multiple times. The withdrawals are awful and I wouldn’t wish it on my own enemy. It’s not like I haven’t tried getting clean; I’ve been to detox, I’ve been to rehab, but for some reason, always go back to it, even though during the time I’m sober, I know I don’t want to. it’s a tough topic to try to explain, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>I understand. Do you actually want to do heroin?</strong></p>
<p>Not anymore! Honestly, I rarely even get high anymore. I just get my ‘sick’ off. My tolerance is so high and I don’t have the money for it, so I can only afford enough to not be in withdrawal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_7199.jpeg"><img width="750" height="1334" alt="" src="https://nextgenerationblogs.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_7199.jpeg?w=750&#038;h=1334" title="" class="size-custom"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of Jess&#8217; Tumblr timeline.</p></div>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Prior to heroin, had you ever used other drugs?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I’ve tried every drug out there pretty much. When I was younger, and in high school, I was messing around with amphetamines a lot. I was always one to say I’d always try something once. I was never physically addicted to any other drug before heroin came in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s different about heroin, do you think?</strong></p>
<p>The physical withdrawals you feel are only 12 hours after your last use. I think that’s a huge part of it, and I never felt the euphoric part of anything before. I was really happy my first time using dope.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever had health problems following the use of heroin?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, no, I’m very lucky. The worst thing is that my veins are collapsed or have too much scar tissue, so I can’t use them.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when your vein collapses?</strong></p>
<p>Well they stop working. You can’t shoot into them anymore. Sorry for the late response, I had to figure out how I was going to get my ‘fix’ today.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s fine. Why do you post content of your heroin usage on Tumblr?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, it’s all that’s on my mind. Also, the people who follow me are 99% of the time heroin addicts. So, I get a lot of questions about it. Someone recently asked me something along the lines of &#8220;How’s heroin, thinking about trying it&#8221; and I wrote out a really long response on why they shouldn’t. I think I got about 20 likes/reposts on it as well. People private message me too, where I can give advice on at least how to use it safe and what to do if something goes wrong, and about clean needles, and how you should always have Narcan available, and all of that sort of stuff. It’s not like I’m like &#8220;I’m a heroin junkie, everyone go try it&#8221;, it’s more like &#8220;I’m a heroin junkie, heroin’s consumed my life and if you’re going to make your decision to try it, or you already are using it, you can ask me anything because I’ve already been through it”.</p>
<p><strong>If you could suddenly stop using heroin forever right now, would you take that opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I would take it in a heartbeat. If I could stop right now, forever, and never have to use it or think about it, or get withdrawal sick ever again, it wouldn&#8217;t even be a thought process. My answer would immediately be “yes”.</p>
<p><strong>What drags you back to it, then?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this last time, I went to rehab which was the longest amount of sobriety from heroin that I&#8217;d had &#8211; which was 27 days or so. Once I got home, I felt really good and I thought I could handle it on my own. I didn&#8217;t listen or do anything that the counsellors recommended me to do once I got back to reality. I didn&#8217;t follow up with after care, like ‘IOP’ or ‘PHP’, I didn&#8217;t go to meetings, I didn&#8217;t get a sponsor; I didn&#8217;t do anything I was supposed to. I thought I had it under control since I was happy again, sober and the ‘addicted’ part of my brain, as I like to call it, tricked me to believe that I could do it by myself. This led me to relapse very, very, very quickly once I got home. I had a bad day or just got bored or whatever reason I used to justify my use/relapse. So, this time when I go to rehab, I&#8217;m actually going to listen to what the counsellors tell me to do because obviously my thought process and the actions I want to do doesn’t work. Obviously, since look where it&#8217;s gotten me, a heroin addict. I am one who has to play with the fire, sometimes once or twice, to actually learn that the fire is hot and I shouldn&#8217;t play with it. I guess that&#8217;s the best way I can explain it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like there is enough support for addicts/ recovering addicts?</strong></p>
<p>I mean there is NA, narcotics anonymous, which is meetings for recovering addicts that are free that work really well if you want them to work, but otherwise, nothing else is typically free. Even with insurance that covered 80% of my last rehab stay, it still cost my mom $3000 US dollars, which is a lot of money. And think about it, if a drug addict will steal A $500 watch and pawn it for $50 just to get a few bags to get their ‘sick’ off, how can someone like that afford rehab? For me personally, it was hard to work the NA program without being sober or without at least without having to go through the withdrawals.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, I hear that financial point a lot. Finally, what would you say to a young person planning on trying heroin for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>This was my response to the person who said they were thinking about trying heroin. &#8220;Please don’t. For the love of your family, your health, your sanity, your motivation, your honesty. For the love of god, please, please, don’t. Heroin is Satan with an angel’s face. The first time I tried it, shit, I thought it was amazing; best feeling I’ve ever felt and here I am, 2 years later, with 2 felony charges, family that is so disappointed they can’t even look at me, no real friends, a few overdoses under my belt, and just no real happiness. Trust me; I never ever thought it would be me. I grew up in a nice suburb outside of Chicago, wasn’t abused, got good grades, played sports all my life, yet here I am &#8211; a god damn heroin junkie who can’t go through a day without getting my damn fix. Drug addiction does not care who you are. It doesn’t care how much you love your family. It doesn’t care that you’re the most popular kid in school. It doesn’t care who the fuck you are, it will take your soul before you even have a chance at seeing all the fucked up shit that’s happening around you because of it. Sorry for the rant, but please, please, don’t try heroin. Not for just one time, not just because your friends are, not because its free and offered to you. Just don’t. Because that’s how I started, and here I am, 2 years later, a depressed, sad, heroin junkie.&#8221; for the love of God, please, don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>That’s a very moving response. And any safety tips, should they choose to go ahead with it anyway?</strong></p>
<p>I mean, a person is eventually going to do what they want to do, no matter what someone tells them, so if they do, do not simply begin injecting it like I did. I’m lucky I didn’t overdose my first time. Sniff a very, very small amount and wait and see how you feel. You can always do more, but you can never do less, and if you are going to use a needle, always, always, always, always, always use clean ones and never share needles with anybody. My advice is &#8211; don’t try it, ever. But if you are, that’s all I’ve got on that.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for speaking with me, Jess. Good luck with everything.</strong></p>
