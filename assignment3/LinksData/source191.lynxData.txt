   elcome to The International Hypnosis Research Institute Web site. Our
   intention is to support and promote the further worldwide integration
   of comprehensive evidence-based research and clinical hypnotherapy with
   mainstream mental health, medicine, and coaching. We do so by
   disseminating, supporting, and conducting research, providing
   professional level education, advocating increased level of
   practitioner competency, and supporting the viability and success of
   clinical practitioners. Although currently over 80% of our membership
   is comprised of mental health practitioners, we fully recognize the
   role, support, involvement, and needs of those in the medical and
   coaching fields. This site is not intended as a source of medical or
   psychological advice. -- Tim Brunson, PhD

   "I have been using the Lesson 2 compounding script with clients with
   much anxiety, just as a way of introduction to the process because they
   are so sure they can't be hypnotized...they have had great success,
   especially with one phobic client...these techniques have been very
   helpful."
