There is a huge amount of evidence that supports the recommendation that adults should typically get 8 hours of sleep per night. Recent research done by the University of Chicago found that sleep improves memory retention and learning new tasks. There was another study by Smaldone et al. from 2007 that examined the effects of sleep on well-being. There were 68,418 participants, children and adolescents included, that completed journal entries and questionnaires. It was found that inadequate sleep was associated with family issues, school troubles, physical problems, and depressive symptoms.<br /><br />The findings are sad due to our increasingly fast-paced society and high-pressure school environments that create a challenge for us to enough sleep each day. There was a study done in 1960 by the American Cancer Society, 1 million participants were involved, that concluded that the median amount of sleep at that time was 8 hours. As of 2008 the number has decreased to only 6.7 hours a night.<br /><br />Obesity and diabetes has been associated with sleep deprivation. Multiple studies on sleep deprivation in healthy young adults indicate that it is associated with up to a 40 % impairment in memory, thinking speed, reaction time, and cognitive ability. Sleep deprivation has also been associated with mood instability and may to lead to over-reactions and impairment of judgement.<br />As I close up this 3-Part Blog on happiness, we find that there is a great amount of evidence showing that exercise, good nutrition, and sleep are associated with our improved mental well-being and, in most cases, reduced depression and anxiety There is still some controversy as to whether these three factors actually cause improved mental well-being or are that those with a greater mental well-being are simply more likely to exercise, sleep well, and maintain a balanced diet. The answer in my personal opinion, from my personal experience, is that exercise, good nutrition, and sleep IMPROVE our mental well-being.<br /><br />When I started my journey, I was in a place I had never been before. I was depressed, lost, consistently suffering from severe anxiety. My nutrition was terrible, I did NOT exercise, and my sleep was about 3 to 4 hours a night. It took everything I had to make the changes I did, but since doing so, I&rsquo;m happier, less to no anxiety, no more depressive symptoms, and I feel like I can take on any challenge in my path.<br /><br />In fact, the end of 2015 I let myself go and I stopped exercising, my eating was horrid, and my sleep was lacking again. As of January 4th, 2016 I pushed myself to get back to my routine. Again, I was feeling depressed, angry, my anxiety made a comeback, and I hated looking at myself. Since starting my journey again. I feel amazing. I have drive, motivation, no more depressive symptoms, and my anxiety is on its way out, AGAIN! So, why not join me on this journey of your happiness and mental well-being? I would love to work with you to help you get yourself to where you WANT to be.</div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>

Although, the few studies that have been done suggest that nutrition plays an important role in our mental well-being and that poor nutrition can negatively affect mental health.<br />&#8203;<br />The human diet consists of 3 major components: protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Fats are crucial and play a VERY important role in the structure and function of the body. Unsaturated fats are further divided into several categories and include the Omega 3 and Omega 6 groups. Basically, Omega 3&rsquo;s are anti-inflammatory and Omega 6&rsquo;s are pro-inflammatory. The diet here in America is rather high in Omega 6&rsquo;s and low in Omega 3&rsquo;s; this leads to high levels of inflammatory disease in our population. Now, the Mediterranean diet is rather high in Omega 3&rsquo;s and has been shown to reduces rates of Cardiovascular Disease by 30 percent. Depression is associated with inflammation and it follows that decreasing inflammation by improving this balance can alleviate symptoms.<br />A study by Grosse et al. (2014) confirmed that supplementation of Omega 3 fatty acids is an effective treatment in patients with depression. Omega 3&rsquo;s also appears to have a direct effect on the brain. Evidence shows that Omega 3&rsquo;s may prevent the development of dementia, and that Omega 3&rsquo;s have a role in the treatment of ADHD (Fares et al., 2014).<br /><br />Another study by Hakkarainen et al. in 2004 examined the impact of diet on the mental health of 29, 133 older male smokers, who logged their daily meals. It was found that greater consumption of processed foods such as margarine and other junk foods with high levels of saturated fats and relatively low levels of Omega 3 fatty acids was associated with increased depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Also, consider the anecdotal study conducted in the movie Fast Food Nutrition that demonstrated alarming health consequences for the one subject who ingested nothing but McDonald&rsquo;s food for 30 days.<br /><br />Sugar is another nutritional factor that affects our mental and physical well-being. It comes in many different forms, but no matter the form of added sugar, it is generally unhealthy. The most common forms are table sugar, beet sugar, honey, agave, high fructose corn syrup, and brown rice syrup.<br /><br />We must remember that sugar, as glucose, provides our body with a fast source of energy. Although, too much sugar causes problems. It can lead to direct stimulation of the brain by triggering the release of dopamine, the &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; neurotransmitter. The effects of sugar on the brain actually resembles that of highly addictive drugs like cocaine. This could explain why we crave something sweet when we are stressed, instead of craving broccoli.<br /><br />The consumption of simple sugars triggers large and rapid release of insulin, a hormone that lowers blood sugar levels. This natural response makes you hungrier, slows down your metabolism, and increases your body&rsquo;s storage of fats. Even though fruits and vegetables contain sugars, they are complex and not broken down as quickly and easily. These complex sugars are bound to fiber, which slows down their absorption and blunts the insulin response.<br /><br />Research indicates that reducing simple sugar intake can even improve ADHD symptoms. If you are looking to balance your blood sugars, it is recommended by doctors and nutritionists to combine healthy sources of protein (meats, eggs, or beans), fats (coconut oil, nuts, or avocado), and carbs (fruits, vegetables, or whole grains) with each meal.<br /></div>

Most likely you feel amazing. This is because exercise causes our body to release endorphins, known as the &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; chemical in the brain. There have been multiple studies done that found that there is a massive association between exercise and improved mood and mental well-being.<br /><br />Researchers that have studied exercise consistently found that there is a positive impact on mood. There have been some researchers that argue that exercise acts as a diversion from negative thoughts, while others argue that exercise improves mood by personal growth and goal attainment, which results from efforts to aster a physical skill. There is research evidence that also shows that social interaction, such as with team and groups, contributes the satisfaction of an individual, leading to mood enhancement.<br /><br />Exercise has also been studied as an alternative treatment to the anti-depressant medication and cognitive-behavioral health currently used to treat depression. According to the Cochran Review, 23 studies were rigorously selected amongst a pool of over 100 studies. The collective evidence concluded that exercise has a &ldquo;large clinical impact&rdquo; on depression.<br /><br />Another study done by Blumenthal et al. compared exercise to a commonly prescribed anti-depressant (Zoloft) in older adults experiencing clinical depression. They found that both treatments were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms.<br />&#8203;<br />The above evidence supports exercise as being beneficial in our happiness and mental well-being, in my opinion. I am looking forward to new studies in this area to learn more.<br /></div>

Well, here is everything you would like to know about my story as a coach.<br />&nbsp;<br />Back in January of 2013 my cousin had order a challenge pack for me. She knew that I had been trying to lose my post baby weight and was struggling The challenge pack consisted of Les Mills Combat and a month&rsquo;s supply of Chocolate Shakeology.<br />&nbsp;<br />I started the program, but got about 2 weeks in and gave up. I felt like I was never going to finish it with 2 toddlers at home, a Kindergartner, homework for myself, a household to manage, and sleeping. So, I gave up. I continued with the shakes, but couldn't see paying so much for it. So....me being so smart and a genius....thought, "Hey, why don't I just use shakes from GNC. I bet I can find something comparable for cheaper."<br />&nbsp;<br />So I did...for a WHOLE YEAR! Guess what?? I found NOTHING! There were some things that sounded close, but I would have still had to spend an extra hundred or two just to add the rest to it every month. That was more than one bag of Shakeology. So, I decided I would become a coach, at least for the discount, if nothing else.<br />&nbsp;<br />February of 2014 I ordered my first challenge pack and signed as a coach. I received 21 Day Fix and Strawberry Shakeology. I was in HEAVEN. A program that was only 3 weeks long, came with a shaker cup, and portion sized color coded containers for my food. I KNEW that this was something I could do...and I DID!!! I killed it. I love 5 lbs in 3 weeks...but the best was that I lost 16 total body inches!!!!<br />&nbsp;<br />This made me a believer. I continued with other programs, and worked as a coach...building myself to a Diamond Coach (which is a great deal to do...and such a great feeling). Shortly after, I lost it...my rank and my motivation.<br />&nbsp;<br />I gained every pound and inch back. As of January 4th I started my journey over, completely...from scratch, EVERYTHING. My weight loss and business. You wanna know why I'm still standing, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE PRODUCTS AND THIS COMPANY! I know it works, I have done it before...and I know for a FACT that I can achieve it again.<br />&nbsp;<br />So, I want to open this up to anyone that feels that they are failing because they lost what they had worked so hard for. I want to invite you to connect with me. We can reach our goals again...and make it further this time. We can support and assist one another on this journey of life!!!!<br /></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>

Did you know that your state of mind id profoundly connected to your diet? Well, the foods we choose to eat are the building blocks of our body, which includes our brains. Our entire body, mind included, is fueled by food, this includes our thoughts and emotions.<br /><br />&#8203;The modern Western world tends to eat a diet that is high in sugar, gluten, omega-6 fatty acids, and toxins. These things have a detrimental effect on our brains and therefore effect our mental health. This typical diet causes inflammation, which in turn triggers a stress response in our brain causing the release of cytokins. When these immune system messengers are inappropriately or excessively produced they affect our brains ability to receive and process signals from other parts of the nervous system. Cytokins are produced in response to increased blood sugar levels, consumption of trans fat, and changes in the bacteria in the gut. Food allergies may also activate the immune system and affect cognition, learning, memory, and mood through this same mechanism.<br /><br />Refined carbohydrates and high sugar foods causes our pancreas to secrete insulin. High insulin levels also creates inflammation. This has been linked to many chronic illnesses, such as, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, but also with mental health conditions like depression. Sugar can have the same effect on our brain as any addictive drug. It causes cravings and withdrawals, plus it can even create depression and anxiety symptoms.<br />Did you know that gluten and casein, if not properly digested, form a morphine-like substance called gluteomorphins and casomorphins? These opiate protein fragments can cross the blood-brain barrier and have been linked to ADHD and schizophrenia. If you have an allergy to either of these things, you should avoid eating products that contain them, such as wheat, barley, rye, and animal products.<br /><br />When it comes to fats, you should be cautious of the types you eat. Omega-3 fatty acids are good fats to intake. They have been utilized in treatments for depression and bipolar disorder. Omega-6 fatty acids are fats you want to steer clear of. They have associated with many negative effects on the brain.<br /><br />Did you know that our gut has a nervous system of its own? Well, in fact our digestive system plays a major role in our mental state as well. The human gut consists of about 100 million nerve cells and uses more than 30 neurotransmitters, just like our brain. It is not widely known, but about 95% of our body&rsquo;s serotonin is found in the gut. The guts nervous system is so crucial that is has been called &ldquo;the second brain&rdquo;. The balance between the microbiome (the bacteria in the gut that is directly affected by your diet) plays a crucial role in our mood and behavior.<br /><br />If you would like to learn about how to alter your diet to assist your mental health and mood, please feel free to visit <a href="http://pinkrootscoaching.weebly.com">PinkRoots Coaching</a>. We are now offering 1-On-1 coaching via phone or video chat to help you learn about the proper foods to eat and what to stay away from to live a balanced and happy life.&nbsp;</div>

As though you have completely lost control of your life? You feel lost, sad, broken, but aren&rsquo;t exactly sure what is bringing you down? The air around you consistently feels heavy and you constantly feel overwhelmed? Yet, at the same time your life is good. You have family and friends that love you. You are doing okay financially, you are able to pay your bills without much struggle, but you still feel as though something is missing. There is just something that places you in this place of dissatisfaction in your life.<br /><br />&#8203;Are you losing your mind? What could be wrong with you? You have a good life, enjoy your job, and love your family and friends. So what could it be?<br />&#8203;<br />Well, honestly, I recently went through something similar. I couldn&rsquo;t pin point what the problem was, constantly looking for something to take it away. The uncertainty I felt was consuming me, dragging me further down.&nbsp; Seeing complaints and bitterness all over my Facebook timeline, or seeing the complete opposite of only the BEST part of someone&rsquo;s life made me feel worse. Then hearing complaints and negativity from those around me physically and eventually hearing negative things coming from my mouth. All that ever exited my mouth was a complaint about something, noting was ever good enough for me.<br /><br />At this point I realized that if I wanted anything about how I felt in my own life to change, then I would have to be willing to alter things within myself and my life. Negativity only attracts more negativity and stress. Stress creates overwhelm, overwhelm creates sadness, sadness creates the lack of motivation, and the lack of motivation creates feeling of being lost. So, to make these changes that were necessary I had to break down each area that got me where I was. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s not easy and it does NOT happen overnight. You just have to be open and willing to listen to your inner most deepest NEEDS. This is not about the things you want, other than the WANT to be happy in your life. By focusing on your NEEDS, your wants will change and become less.<br /><br />First thing needed to help dig myself out of the hole I found myself in was to get motivated again. Motivated to live, not just breathe and survive. So, I started with working out again. This helped me drastically with my motivation to do more than just survive. It also helped with my sadness and feelings of despair. But, I still had other aspects to work on.<br /><br />It was not time for me to reflect. I had to think back, back to when I truly felt happy and free. What was I doing then? How was my though process different? What did I believe and practice daily? THAT WAS IT!!! That was the major turning point for me. The key that was missing was my spirituality. I have always believed that there is more than what we physically see. I have seen it, heard it, and felt it. Somewhere I lost this belief, or shoved it away while I focused on what I thought was more important (which was everything but me). I used to meditate daily, do tarot readings for friends and openly allowed spirit in my life. All that got blocked, creating anxiety, fear, stress, and sadness. I had become someone I didn&rsquo;t know. Someone sad and filled with hate, fear, and jealousy. Jealousy of everyone else who seemed to have what I no longer did, HAPPINESS.<br /><br />So, the next move for me was to get back to my spiritual beliefs. To reconnect with what was more important to me once upon a time. This process has been the hardest and longest. I&rsquo;m still a work in progress here. Although much has changed since I began this journey. I have begun to feel less stressed, less fear and anxiety, and have begun to attract more positive things into my life. Things have been slowly falling into place since I started this journey of happiness and finding myself once again. There is much work still needed, but I am happy with the transformation I have made thus far.<br /><br />If you are finding yourself in a lonely, dark and sad place, don&rsquo;t be afraid to reach out to someone. It is a lot of hard work, but it is definitely worth it. If you are looking to work with someone to help you through, I would love to work with you.<br />Life is hard, especially when you feel alone and don&rsquo;t know where to start. So, why not allow someone to help you get started, so you too, can have a happier and more simple life experience this time around.</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style='text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(42, 42, 42); '>  We all have heard about how proper nutrition and physical exercise are great for our bodies, but do they play a role in helping to treat or control chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity (in adults and children), and blood pressure? If you or anyone know suffers from any of the above, you know just how serious they all are. It is crucial that those of us that have family members suffering from one of the above illnesses that we begin to do what we can to help prevent them from happening to us. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, you can&rsquo;t always prevent something that is inherited, but you can help to get numbers lowered and be healthier than our past generations by simply educating yourself on specific diseases and how preventable they truly are without medications. Remember, medications take their toll on our bodies as well. Our lives and kidneys work hard daily to process all the toxins and remove them from our bodies, this includes toxins we take in through our skin as well, why would you want to add a stress on those organs? When you do this you create more of an issue on an already hard working organ. This might cause yet more issues later on for you, issues that are not connected to what the medication originally was prescribed to cover symptoms or &ldquo;treat&rdquo;. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Many are not aware that medications for specific illnesses are not a treatment, they are strictly a form used to mask symptoms or to prolong your life, but you will have to RELY on these medications for the rest of your life. In that time those medications can cause cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney failure, and etc. Is it really worth doing this to your body if you can start now in the prevention or to help lower you numbers so you take in less medications at lowest dosages? Well, here is some information for you to read and help you understand exactly what healthy nutrition and exercise can do for you.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Improvement of Quality of Life</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Consistent physical exercise helps to relieve tension, anxiety, depression, and anger. Most individuals get a sensation that creates a good feeling directly after working out. This, over-time helps to improve how one feels as they make exercise a routine in their life. The routine would be getting 30 minute works out in 5 days a week. This could be 3-10 minute workouts a day, if you don&rsquo;t have time for a full 30 minute workout. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  When an individual is not physically active they tend to be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and more. There was a study done with adults that watched more than 4 hours of television a day, they showed to have a 45% chance of an increased risk of death from any health cause and an 80% increase risk of death from cardiovascular disease. When you choose to become more active you can lower your blood pressure and raise your good cholesterol levels.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  When an individual does not partake in physical exercise regularly many things happen to the body, in negative ways. The human body slowly loses strength, stamina, and the ability to properly function with age in one that is not active. Individuals that are physically active and at a healthy weight tend to live about 7 years longer than an individuals that DOES NOT exercise regularly and that are obese. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Bone Health</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Many times individuals are not concerned about bone health until it is too late. Exercise has been proven to help treat and prevent osteoporosis. Bones, like our muscles, are also living tissue which responds to exercise by growing stronger. Men and women that begin exercising at younger ages generally have great bone mass than those that do not. Bone mass tends to peak during our thirties. After this time our bodies can start to lose bone. Individuals older than 20 are able to prevent bone loss through regular exercise. With exercise we are able to maintain or gain muscle strength, coordination, and balance which helps us in the prevention of falls and fractures. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Childhood Obesity</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  According to research, after only 3 months, there was a significant difference in changes within the body weight, body fat percentage, serum total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fitness in the intervention group. At the 1 year follow up there were major differences between the intervention group and control group in their body weight, BMI, and a large increase in the leisure-time physical activity among the intervention group as compared to a decrease in the control group. The findings showed that both short and long term physical exercise is beneficial among obese children. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Obesity in Adults</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Prevention and treatment of obesity can be simple with just the change of a healthy diet, proper portion control, and physical exercise. The physical activity is known to reduce body fat and increase muscle mass, therefore it improves your body&rsquo;s ability to burn more calories. Remember, the more muscle, the more calories are burned even when resting. One can treat obesity by simply reducing their caloric intake making sure to get in 30 minutes of physical exercise 5 days a week. Being able to control obesity is crucial, since it is causes one to be at a higher risk of other diseases. By simply lowering your BMI you can reduce the risk of death and give yourself more years of life. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Cardiovascular Health (Stroke, Blood Pressure, and Heart Disease)</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  According to research fitness programs are more successful then nutrition alone, particularly for women. For women there was a reduction of the diastolic blood pressure, less obesity, and increased fitness translated into a substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk in life. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Physical exercise done regularly helps to keep the heart muscle strong, lowers blood pressure, increases the good cholesterol (LDL&rsquo;s) and lowers the bad cholesterol (HDL&rsquo;s), increases the blood flow, and assists the heart to function more efficiently. All of this helps in the reduction of stroke, heart disease, and high blood pressure.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Type II Diabetes</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Type II Diabetes has risen by about 62% since 1990, which is not something we should brag about as it affects about 17 million Americans. Physical exercise is known to help with weight loss and therefore will help with the prevention or control of this disease. By simply losing weight one can increase their sensitivity to insulin, improve their blood sugar levels, improve their cholesterol levels, and help reduce their blood pressure. All of these things are very important to control in an individual with diabetes. According to a study by Frank Hy, MD, it was found that simply walking briskly for one hour a day helped to reduce the risk of Type II Diabetes by 34%.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Back Pain</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  By simply incorporating physical exercise that increases muscle strengthening and flexibility into your daily routine you can prevent or manage chronic back pain. Having good posture and a strong core (abdomen) is one of the best ways to fight off back pain.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Psychological Issues</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Regular physical exercise is known to improve self-esteem, but it also causes your body to release endorphins which have been proven to improve mood. This feeling is often described as euphoric and followed by a positive outlook. Stress, depression, and anxiety can all be prevented or treated with daily exercise. When we look at the nutrition side of things, anxiety can be prevented and treated by simply adding more fresh fruits, vegetables, water, tryptophan rich foods, foods rich in magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Be cautious of, and stay away from foods that are fried, alcohol, coffee (things with lots of caffeine), dairy products, refined sugars, and acid forming foods (eg., yogurt, pickles, eggs, wine, and sour cream).<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  As you have read, there are many health benefits of exercise and nutrition, not only in prevention, but in treatment of several diseases. Recently many individuals that are trying to lose fat are turning to procedures to shrink their stomach, all this does is simply cause you to eat less, which is not always good either. Our bodies need a specific amount of nutrients that are better absorbed through foods (vegetables and fruits). Then there are others that turn to the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; and &ldquo;quick&rdquo; way to lose weight, diet pills. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  This topic is something that I have been hearing about more and more. These &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; create more health issues than you could know. Many are packed with more caffeine than the human heart can handle, which over time will cause one to suffer from a stroke or heart attack. Many of these pills have been known to cause issues with the thyroid, or destroy it all together, making weight loss even harder. The BEST and SAFEST way to get HEALTHY is through proper diet and exercise. If you are unsure where to start, please feel free to contact me. I would love to help you get started and learn more about what you can do to start changing your health and body.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  </span></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style='text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(42, 42, 42); '>  One of the most crucial things an individual faces in life is food choice. It is necessary for survival to be motivated to choose foods that are nutritious, safe, and yet appetizing. People spend a large amount of their time consuming and choosing their foods every day. There is much involved in the food selection process, such as, the search for the food, the proper selection, the preparation, and even the ingestion of the food (Rozin, 1990). Each action takes up a major part of one&rsquo;s day. Food choices may be a challenge for people, since there are a variety of foods to choose from (Rozin via Shutts, Kinzler, &amp; DeJesus, 2013). Whether a food is edible or not is one of the most crucial choices facing children during their choice making process. With all of the options available, what motivates a child to choose the food that would be best for them? <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Eating tends to be a very personal action; it can jeopardize the individual as it introduces outside foods into the body. One source that has been proven to be linked to pleasure for humans is food, and in the U.S. it is many times the source of fear as it has been said to be a fattener of human bodies or even as a carcinogen carrier (Rozin, 1990). The choice of food has been associated with cognitive associations, like that of knowledge and attitude, as opposed to other biological needs. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  No matter the meaning and intricacy of the food choice, developmental psychologists have not yet given much attention to the study of how children may regard, learn about, and make sense of food (Shutts, Kinzler, &amp; DeJesus, 2013). There has not been much time spent on the study of food choices in children. There are, however, current articles that state that children utilize many beneficial means to back their capacity to make proper food choices beginning in early age. This shows that children are able to learn, on their own, about things that are edible and things that are not. Past research has revealed that children will demonstrate disadvantages when it comes to food expertise. An example is from research done by Shutts, Kinzler, &amp; DeJesus (2013) explaining that toddlers more times than not will choose to consume dangerous foods. By simply establishing models of individual, social, and environmental influences on food choices, there may be the possibility to promote healthy eating habits. Other studies have shown that food availability and economic resources to acquire food is a center determinant of food selection (Michela &amp; Contento, 1986). Although, according to Ferguson, Contreras, and Kilburn (2014), children between the ages of 3 and 6 will choose foods depending on advertising, while older children make choices dependent upon their parents influence.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  As humans we are considered omnivores, which means that our systems can handle a variety of foods. We are able to eat a wide range of different types of foods, there may still be some risks involved, since there is still the chance of consuming toxic foods or the possibility of eating an imbalanced diet (Rozin, 1990). Due to these reasons it is important that individuals learn what foods are healthy and edible and what is not, what amounts each can be ingested and with what. As an example, corn is an incomplete food, but is considered a good food, even though it is low in amino acids. If one were to eat corn and beans together then they would meet the need of amino acids and protein necessary.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Adequate food choice is very important and crucial to the survival of humans and so the issue arises as to what is edible and what is not. It is important that individuals are able to avoid toxins and learn to eat a balanced diet that must be learned early on in life. In the first 3 months of life people live off of milk or formula as their source of proper nutrition, but this can later create complex choices. The choices will contain both edible and dangerous items. People teach their children about food and food choices, but are they teaching them nutritiously healthy choices (Rozin, 1990)? Children struggle while learning what foods are edible and safe, but it is crucial to their health and well-being. This can create one parent-child issues through out early life, usually between the ages of 2 and 5 (Rozin, 1990). It has been shown that children in the younger years, between the ages of 3 and 6 are influenced by advertising of foods, as opposed to the older aged children whom are more influenced my parental and peer influence (Ferguson, Contreras, &amp; Kilburn, 2014).<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The influence that advertising has on the unhealthy choices of foods in children has been a topic of concern for many years. The American Psychological Association has advised that advertising could have harmful effects on children&rsquo;s healthy eating (American Psychology Association, via Ferguson, Contreras, &amp; Kilburn, 2014). Exposure to unhealthy food advertisements has proven to encourage younger aged children to make unhealthy food choices. There have been studies done proving that food choices and advertising influence children depending upon where they are developmentally. Parental influence seems to be more prominent in middle aged childhood and peer influence seems to more prominent in older childhood (Ferguson, Contreras, &amp; Kilburn, 2014).<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  When a child is given the opportunity to choose their own food, what would be the biggest influence in their choice? It will be hypothesized that the majority of children will make food choices dependent upon their own opinion of the look, taste, or texture with little consideration to parental or advertising influence. Studies that were done with adults had shown that taste appeal or sensory appeal is a main factor when making food choices, dependent upon ones likes and dislikes (Michela &amp; Contento, 1986). The belief that a food may be nutritious seemed to also play a role in the food choice process. Children might determine the foods they eat due to the colors of the food or how it looks. If the food is something that a child has had prior, they may determine whether they will eat it again due to texture and taste from their more recent experience. Some children may not choose specific foods that had been introduced during a traumatic period. For instance, if a child ate spaghetti then got sick shortly after causing them to vomit, they may feel negatively about this food. This situation creates a negative reaction to the food and may prevent them from choosing that food the next time it is offered.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Review of Literature Used as Research</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Makings choices in food is something that is very crucial to the livelihood of all individuals. Understanding what influences and motives children&rsquo;s choices in food can help to decrease childhood obesity as well as other health consequences due to lack of nutrients in the body. There are several things that could influence food choices in children, such as advertising and media messages, parental guidance or social influence, and taste, texture, and the look of specific foods (Ferguson, Contreras, &amp; Kilburn, 2014; Michela &amp; Contero, 1986; Rozin, 1990; Shutts, Kinzler, &amp; DeJesus, 2013). The study would research the food choices made by children through questionnaires sent to families determining what motivates the choices of food by the children when on their own accord. It will be hypothesized that children will make their food choices dependent upon their own opinion of the look, taste, or texture with little consideration to parental or advertising influence.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The research article by Michela and Contero (1986) focused their research on three different aspects of food choices by children. Preference had previously been studied and was found to be a determining factor in children&rsquo;s food choices. Michela and Contero (1986) wanted to incorporate the basis of cognitive and motivation in food choices, the influence of personal and environmental factors, and the differences in cognition levels in children and the impact it had on food choices. It was hypothesized that children were generally unaware of health or any consequences of foods besides the taste, or possibly environmental factors, as contributions to the choices made in their foods (Michela &amp; Contero, 1986). <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The study utilized a total of 107 elementary school children, aged from 5 to 13 years. The participants were 60 girls and 47 boys. Those that were from the suburban school were predominantly white and were middle class to upper-middle class; those from the urban school were split evenly between white and non-white students that were lower to middle class (Michela &amp; Contero, 1986). Most of the students in the study were found to select foods they believed to be tasty or healthful. Michela and Contero (1986) sought additional evidence on the motivational aspect, which had shown that health concerns or foods thought be healthier were preferred and chosen more. This research put an emphasis on the importance of food choices by children and the reasons behind the choices they make.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The article by Rozin (1990) was written in order to draw attention to the importance that food, eating, and food choices have on society and developmental psychology. It was stated that individuals develop internalizations (likes and dislikes), category formation (edible or inedible), cognitive-affective relationship (disgust and contagion), communication of preferences, and transition to food independence (Rozin, 1990). It was explained that there are two models for how one might make their choice of foods in order to fix or prevent nutrient deficiencies. One of those models is innate recognition of the needed nutrient and the other is the general ability to eat what makes an individual feel better, or to avoid what may cause an individual to get worse. Rozin (1990) continues to explain that when it comes to learning it was not ever researched or clear who one learns to eat foods that will help in deficiencies or to prevent deficiencies, other than through guidance. As for internalization, it was believed that specific items would be accepted or rejected because of liking or disliking due to sensory aspects. Those aspects are taste, smell, and appearance. Rozin (1990) felt that most rejections and acceptances were motivated by reasons that would fall into multiple categories, such as milk could be considered tasty and beneficial. It was determined that there is not any research in this area which would be important to determine what motivates one to make the food choices they make.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The main point of Rozin&rsquo;s (1990) article was to bring attention to how important food, eating, and food selection are in the social sphere in development. Food is at the center of life and remains a crucial role in one&rsquo;s daily life. Many of the issues that are brought up in the study of food choice, such as internalization, are among the most fundamental in developmental psychology (Rozin, 1990). Since eating is important to human activity, food selection is particularly concerning when advertising is a major part of society. Since it has been determined that food choices are socially learned, it is important to determine all aspects of contributors when investigation the motivation and influence on food choices. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Ferguson, Contreras, and Kilburn (2014) chose to examine the influence that advertising, fictional media, and parents had on a child&rsquo;s food choice. It had been determined that advertising played some role in the influence of food choices, yet it was unclear as to the degree of influence when paired with parental guidance. There were four different hypothesis in this study in order to determine a more accurate finding. The first hypothesis was that children age 3-5 that were exposed to unhealthy food advertising would be more apt to choose unhealthy foods, but middle aged children would not be influenced as much. The second hypothesis was that children exposed to fictional media would not be as influenced as with advertising. The third hypothesis was that the impact of advertising dropped in the older aged children, as they would be more able to process the media messages. The fourth and final hypothesis was that parental message moderated the impact advertising had on children food choices.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Ferguson, Contreras, and Kilburn (2014) found that advertising and fictional media had an influence on the younger aged children and their food choices, yet not with middle aged or older children. In middle aged children the parental message had the biggest influence on their food choices, as opposed to media message. The younger children were more susceptible to media messages when it came to food choices, but by middle age had diminished completely (Ferguson, Contreras, &amp; Kilburn, 2014). This study focused on advertising and how it effects the food choices of children, but as it was found, the parental message had the most impact which shows us that social learning plays a large part in why a child chooses the foods they do.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  A study done by Shutts, Kinzler, and DeJesus (2013) focused on how development of social cognition influences food choices. Focus was mostly on the influence that other people play in guiding a child&rsquo;s choice in foods. There was a need to understand the patterns of success and failures in food choices made by children when left to their own devices (Shutts, Kinzler, &amp; DeJesus, 2013). The study wanted to prove that social learning contributes greatly to eating and food choice in children of all ages. It was hypothesized that &ldquo;social information indicative of cultural differences &ndash; in particular, the accent and language individuals speak &ndash; will have a profound impact on food choices&rdquo; (Shutts, Kinzler, &amp; DeJesus, 2014, p. 421). There were three factors that motivated the hypothesis of the authors. Those factors were that children follow the accent and language of others, cultures tend to differ dramatically in eating habits, and accent and language give dependable information about an individual&rsquo;s social identity. Shutts, Kinzler, and DeJesus (2013) found that many times foods are rejected in children due to cultural influence, even if the foods have been introduced repeatedly. This shows that culture and our social setting plays a very important role in the choices a child makes when determining what to eat.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">My Personal Opinion</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  According to the studies shared above, I feel that we can hypothesize that children will make choices in their foods based upon parental and cultural influences, taste and texture, and the look of specific foods, no so much due to advertising and media influence. Since this is the hypothesis that one can come to from the above research, it is imperative that, we, as parents not only teach our children then proper (healthy) choices in foods, but to be the example. It is crucial that we don&rsquo;t just TELL them what to eat, we must also eat these foods that promote as healthy and good. As a child grows, they will learn more from out example than our words. Remember, for one to gain true health we must also incorporate exercise.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  In order to make sure that we leave our children with a healthy routine and the knowledge of proper health we must not just tell them, we must live it. Be the healthy and positive example your children need. Would you want to teach your child bad habits that could take their life early on? Would you want your child to have to bury you at a young age because you couldn&rsquo;t live by what you preached to them? Most likely not, I know I wouldn&rsquo;t like either situation. I want my children to be heathy, strong, and be able to share their knowledge with their children and others in the world. I can&rsquo;t save the whole world all at once, but I can help individuals learn how they can help others like I do. Simply saving one life and teaching them the right ways will always pay off and save more lives later on. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">References:</u></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <span style="">Ferguson, C.

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style='text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(42, 42, 42); '>  Exercise is one of the most UNDERRATED things. Many people think that by simply altering their diet they can lose weight and be healthy, but the reality is that you will lose fat and muscle mass with only altering your diet. The true magic happens when you learn to eat your proper portions for your body type and EXERCISE. Exercise helps to keep all the muscles of the body strong, including your heart and other organs of the body (skin and bones included). Exercise helps us to combat signs of aging, helps the body to regulate it&rsquo;s temperature, helps with stress reduction, and weight control. It&rsquo;s fantastic what adding a simple exercise routine into your daily life can do for you. Many have lowered their blood pressure, cholesterol, A1C&rsquo;s, and more by simply altering their diet to less animal proteins, more fresh fruits and vegetables, and EXERCISE. Below I will go more into detail about how exercise truly helps the human body.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Aerobic Exercise:</u></strong> This type of exercise works muscles at a rate that does not exceed the body&rsquo;s ability to keep them supplied with oxygen in the blood. If you are looking for a way to INCREASE MUSCLE ENDURANCE (the length a muscle can sustain contractions), then regular aerobic exercise is the way for you. This would include brisk walking, biking, jogging, swimming, and aerobic classes. This type of exercise works the mucles at a rate at which the body is able to keep them supplied with oxygen, although it does affect the muscle fibers in many way, such as : an increase in the number and the size of the mitochondria, the organelles that make the ATP, the number of blood capillaries that supply the muscle tissues increase (this increase brings more oxygen and nutrients to the muscle tissue and helps to remove metabolic wastes more efficiently), and muscle tissue contains more of the oxygen-binding pigment myoglobin. When all of these come together, the changes produce skeletal muscles that are more efficient metabolically, that maintain their tone, and that can work longer without becoming fatigued. This type of exercise improves your endurance and blood circulation. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Strength Training:</u></strong> This type of exercise is intense, short-duration that produces larger, stronger skeletal muscles. It involves intense, short-duration exercises, such as weight lifting. It effects fast muscle fibers, which form more myofibrils and make more of the enzymes used in glycolysis (which forms some ATP). These changes translate into whole muscles that are larger and stronger, but such bulging muscles fatigue rapidly so they don&rsquo;t have much endurance. It is generally recommended that you combine strength training with aerobic exercise. Modest strength training helps to slow the loss of skeletal muscle tissue that is an inevitable part of aging.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Bone Health:</u></strong> Exercise is known to stimulate bone deposits, along with taking in plenty of calcium, you may minimize bone loss. Osteoarthritis has been linked to sports injuries, obesity, and simply age.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Type 2 Diabetes: </u></strong>In many individuals that have been diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes, it can be regulated with proper diet, EXERCISE, and in some cases medication. In an individual that is deemed to be overweight with Type-2 Diabetes, the disease will often disappear once the individuals loses a significant amount of weight. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Stress:</u></strong> Chronic stress can be a serious issue. It compromises the immune system leaving an individual more susceptible to disease and illness. It is also linked to insomnia, anxiety, and even depression. In order to help with stress, research has shown that physical exercise on a regular basis helps to combat stress, which in turn helps to keep your immune system strong, helps you sleep better, and helps combat depression and anxiety.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Weight Loss:</u></strong> It is true that you can lose weight simply with diet, but you must remember that in order to lose weight you must remember the energy in, equals energy used by the body cells. In order to lose just 1 pound of fat, one must burn about 3,500 calories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diet alone may accomplish this, but only temporarily. If you are looking to make it a life altering thing, that you can continue over the long run, then its best to add in some physical exercise. Exercise increases the mass of skeletal muscles, and even at rest muscle burns more calories than other types of tissues.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  So, overall, if you are looking to lose fat it is highly recommended to add in some sort of physical exercise into your daily routine. This not only helps in weight loss, but it plays a huge factor in your over health and your aging process. As we age we lose bone density, muscle mass, and our body slows down. If you get yourself moving early enough in, then you may be able to help you maintain your bone density, muscle mass, and help to keep your body energy higher than most. You will also notice major differences in your body, which is a MAJOR plus!<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  </span></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style='text-decoration:none; font-style:normal; font-weight:400; color:rgb(42, 42, 42); '>  An eating disorder is a VERY serious issue. The average person has had times when they haven&rsquo;t eaten enough or have eaten more than necessary in a day. The true issue is when lack of eating (anorexia) or overeating (binge eating) becomes a habit. Below I will briefly explain each disorder both physically and psychologically. We will start with the physical aspects of them.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><em style="" "mso-bidi-font-style:="" normal"=""><u style="">PHYSICAL </u></em></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Anorexia Nervosa</u></strong> &ndash; This is typically an individual that views themselves as overweight, not matter how thin they may truly be. They will intentionally starve themselves, not how hungry they may become. They may also tend to over exercise in order to burn calories that they are not supplying to their body. Unfortunately, there are some side effects with this disorder, and they are: heart arrhythmias, osteoporosis, and cessation of menstruation (or amenorrhea) (Starr &amp; McMillan, 2012). <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Binge Eating</u></strong> &ndash; This is when an individual eats abnormally large amounts of food in just a few hours. They will do this at least two times a week for about 6 months or so (Starr &amp; McMillan, 2012). With binge eating also ties in the next disorder.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Bulimia Nervosa</u></strong> &ndash; This individual may consume as much as 50,000 calories at one sitting (binge eating) and then intentionally force themselves to vomit, take a laxative, or do both (Starr &amp; McMillan, 2012). Bulimics are the opposite of anorexics, where this disorder is easier to hide from others due to the individual not becoming emaciated. This may cause one to live with this disorder for many years without any detection or help. This disorder holds with it many health issues, such as the erosion of enamel on the teeth due to consistent vomiting and the rupture of the stomach from chronic vomiting. It may also lead to chemical imbalances that could lead to kidney and heart failure. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  This is just the physical sides of these disorders, there is also a psychological tie-in, and below we will discuss each.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><em style="" "mso-bidi-font-style:="" normal"=""><u style="">PSYCHOLOGICAL</u></em></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Anorexia Nervosa</u></strong> &ndash; Anorexia tends to be rooted in many psychological and emotional issues, as well as social factors. It was found that many female dancer and athletes may become anorexic in order to attempt to achieve an ultra-thin body that they may deem as crucial to their success. If untreated, ANOREXIA CAN KILL, but individuals that are able to receive treatment are able to return to a healthy weight (Starr &amp; McMillan, 2012). <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Binge Eating</u></strong> &ndash; Binge eating tends to be tied in with emotional issues. Many times individuals that binge eat do so to try to stop or control emotion pains or scares for their past. Psychological counseling could help one to regain a healthy perspective on food, this includes helping with the healing of the emotional blocks (Starr &amp; McMillan, 2012).<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Bulimia Nervosa</u></strong> &ndash; Depression is a major factor with many cases researched about this disorder. Psychological counseling and supportive group therapy have been proven to help one suffering with bulimia, although anti-depressants have also been seen to make a difference in some individuals (Starr &amp; McMillan, 2012).<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><em style="" "mso-bidi-font-style:="" normal"=""><u style="">SIGNS OF DISORDER</u></em></strong><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Anorexia Nervosa</u></strong> &ndash; The refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimal normal weight for their age and height. An intense fear of gaining weight and/or becoming fat, despite being underweight. Distorted body image or denial that their current body weight is below a minimum healthy standard. In women, no menstrual periods for at least three months.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <strong style=""><u style="">Bulimia Nervosa</u></strong> &ndash; Binge eating that includes a sense of no control over their behavior. Inappropriate compensating behavior to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or enemas, and excessive exercise. Binging/inappropriate compensating behavior (purging or over-exercising) occurs at least twice a week for 3 months. Over-concern with body weight and shape.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  These disorders are a serious issue and could possibly lead to death if they are not treated properly. They are not something to joke about, but to take seriously. Many times these individuals that suffer with an eating disorder are fighting a much larger battle. In some cases they feel as though they have no control in their life, and this is the only thing they CAN control. Please DO NOT judge them by their disorder, instead reach out a hand and help them through the tunnel. Today our society has put a lot of notice on depression, anxiety, and PTSD, but eating disorders are still something that some people don&rsquo;t take serious enough. As I listed, binge eating is a tough one, since many people don&rsquo;t really understand what it is. It is, many times what causes one to become overweight. These individuals are using food to hide from emotional trauma or some sort of psychological issue that they are not ready to come to grips with yet. If someone is overweight due to binge eating for psychological or emotional issues, it isn&rsquo;t as easy and giving them a diet and exercise program, you need to work with them on a different level. It&rsquo;s all about learning to combine the physical and mental together. Help them shed their psychologically or emotionally troubles, and you will then be able to help them begin to shed the weight. REMEMBER, it ISN&rsquo;T about how you LOOK, IT IS about your HEALTH!<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Reference:<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Starr, C. &amp; McMillan, B.

<p style="text-align:left;">First and foremost I am a mother and wife. I have three children that range in age from 4 - 8. They are what takes up most of my time, yet I have found time to continue doing hair, massage, being a full-time student, and a full-time Beachbody Coach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p>
