Our Experience In International Personal Injury Claims

   If you need to make a compensation claim after suffering an illness or
   being involved in an accident while abroad, it’s important to choose
   specialist lawyers to help you. Our highly experienced team is the
   largest and most successful in the UK. In the last two years alone we
   secured over £100 million in damages for our clients following injury
   or death abroad.

   We have an unrivalled track record in helping the victims of
   international personal injury, with a number of our clients recovering
   record compensation through negotiated settlements or court awards. We
   have represented clients in highly complex, ground breaking and
   precedent setting cases in the English courts and overseas, including
   the European Court of Justice.

   In many cases you can claim in the UK, but if your claim has to be made
   abroad, we have decades of experience of foreign legal systems. We also
   have foreign qualified lawyers and experts who are fluent in languages
   including French, German, Portuguese and Spanish.

   Several of the team have leading international reputations for their
   work and the team is recognised in independent research as the “crème
   de la crème of claimant lawyers” in the field of international personal
   injury.

   For over a decade the independent legal guides, Chambers & Partners and
   the Legal 500, have consistently ranked us as the UK’s leading law firm
   acting for victims with international personal injury claims.

   "Practice head Clive Garner is a “game changer, who knows foreign and
   international law like the back of his hand."
   Legal 500 2015

   The power of this firm rests in its 'Worldwide expertise, comprising
   five partners and 48 lawyers.' Its talent covers a range of
   jurisdictions and accident areas. Although collecting a massive volume
   of instructions ranging from minor to catastrophic injury claims,
   sources note its ability to 'consider each case carefully in light of
   the implications of local law and achieve some fantastic results with
   it'."
   Chambers & Partners

   “This team is rated as the best international PI claimant group in the
   country, having built an 'established and high-quality practice' that
   'commands respect throughout the industry.'”
   Chambers & Partners

   Know Before You Go

How We Will Work With You

   When you first contact us, we’ll talk to you about what happened and
   give you our honest view on your chances of success. If you choose to
   go ahead, we’ll then investigate your case thoroughly by gathering
   evidence and will seek to strengthen your claim by working with leading
   experts.

   We’ll consider the impact of your injuries or illness in order to
   understand how much compensation you may be entitled to. Your
   compensation payment should take into account both past and future
   issues including:
     * Pain and suffering
     * Lost earnings
     * Medical costs, both in the UK and overseas
     * The cost of care, rehabilitation, aids and appliances etc
     * All other financial losses and expenses caused by your injury.

   All of these factors will combine to help us assess how much
   compensation you are entitled to. You should rest assured that we will
   do everything we can to help you recover the maximum amount possible.

   If your injuries are serious, we will also help you access any
   specialist medical care and rehabilitation you need. Brain, spinal cord
   and other serious injuries can be life-changing but our substantial and
   award winning experience in this area means we can help you get your
   life back on track and achieve a good quality of life.
