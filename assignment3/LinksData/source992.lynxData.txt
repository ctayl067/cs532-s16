     Hello, hello

   Thanks for stopping by. I write novels about people falling in love,
   among other things.

   My first book had a very pink cover and was called [17]Step on it,
   Cupid. Then a year later came [18]Lost For Words; a romantic comedy set
   in a publishing house.

   Since then I've been busy writing a few other things - everything from
   short films to adverts, from poems to post-it notes... but finally, the
   difficult third novel has arrived! I bring you, [19]Reader, I Dumped
   Him - A love story about break-ups.

   It’s about four Londoners at the fag-end of their twenties. It
   celebrates what becomes of the consciously-uncoupled, when they happen
   to all consciously-uncouple at the exact same time…. end up forming a
   slightly pathetic club, and fall head over heels with each other.
   [20]You can read and watch all about it here.

   For now, feel free to have a look around... watch [21]some
   movies....read the [22]news... or look at [23]my blog.

                          [24]Reader, I Dumped Him

   You'd be DAFT to miss out on this fab book - it's blimmin' marvellous!
                                 I LOVED it!
