[7][20160218] Exactly what my instincts said to me... ARE TOTALLY TRUE &
REAL.

   [8][tumblr_inline_o1vtihEysM1tnp4r2_540.png]
   What... what the flower you want?
   I've guessed much, and all of them ended to be true. Like... ugh. My
   life has been always pitiful.
   And I hate to go back home. I don't want to stay at home because I
   could feel stresses and I'm feeling so down when I'm at home. Feels
   like... I wanna run away? Anywhere but far from home. Anywhere.
   Being a very nice and good girl isn't me, to be honest. ahh lantaklah
   broken English sekalipun.
   I don't wanna blame anyone but I'm too upset and frustrated with these
   matters. I should be rational and think before I act. But, nah, this is
   unfair. So heart-breaking! Why do I had to live in this mufu'in land
   called Malaysia?? Ughh... please. History repeats itself (or maybe it
   doesn't changed at all).
   Since January 2016, I've lost most of my hopes, energy, goals... and I
   couldn't see the road that I'm taking for. I'm afraid. Worried if I
   chose the wrong path (bcuz you know this Malaysia land have lost its
   sights and we're upside down).
   Maybe I can overcome this soon. Please give me more hopes.
   Even though I can score a few subjects for exam (at least 5 subjects),
   I'm not sure if I can survive with it. Duh...
   Only fools fall for our latest ** I really don't like him and I really
   want to kick him outta this country.
   AND SITTING AT HOME JUST MAKING ME STRESSED WITH MY MOM I DUNNO BUT I
   DON'T LIKE EVERY SINGLE THING THAT MY MOM SAID BECAUSE IT HURTS MY
   HEART SO THAT'S WHY I TRY THE BEST TO NOT GETTING CLOSE OR TALK OR HAVE
   A TOPIC TO TALK WITH BECAUSE SHE WILL PROBABLY TEASING ME WHICH IS
   REALLY ANNOYING AND HURT and it feels like she's insulting me all the
   time with that 'jokes'. My (personal) life is already pitiful and she
   make it even worst if I ever talked to her about my problems and she
   won' give me encouragement but making me even more down. ot to forget
   that she's the main reason why I became so annoying when I talked with
   them. They said that my voice are really annoying and I acted like a...
   gedik but when I kept quiet I just realize that my mom had being that
   way and me, dunno when, follows her style of talking. LIKE WTF!!!! I'm
   not like that before!!!!! If you don't believe me ask my friends and my
   siblings!
   I'm so upset with everything and everything seems so wrong with me.
   DID MY MOM HATE CATS/KITTENS? THAT'S SO CRUEL!! Stop complaining about
   us watching a cat documentary or stories or drooled over some cats
   around us BECAUSE CATS ARE INCREDIBLY CUTER THAN YOU. I had an allergy
   to feathers and dusts too but I still tend to like them like wtf mom
   please don't judge the things that I like. Liking cats is not bad, you
   know? AT LEAST  I DIDN'T RUN AWAY FROM HOUSE BECAUSE I HAD ALWAYS
   WANTED TO DO THAT BUT THANKS GOD I WAS STILL ON MY  RIGHT MIND SO I
   STAY AND LOCKED MYSELF IN MY BEDROOM.
   arghh my heart is burning rn.
   I'm not hating her but I'm just... unsatisfied. How can they be close
   to their mom? I can't even. I don't think there's chemistry running
   between us at all. Both of us have a totally different interests,
   perangai, etc. If she's not my mom, I will ended up hating her and
   she'll be my enemy rn.
   SORRY. OKAY, SORRY. I'M NOT HATING, BUT I WAS UPSET.
   Please slap my face to wake me up from this immature side of myself.
   Thank you.
   P/s: I'm so disappointed. and I've been disappointed for so many times.

[32][20160202] Just Some Stupid Confession.

   me: *pats jk's shoulder*
   I know how you feel, bro. Literally the same. We're same. The only
   different is, there's still no one who scold me to make me wake from my
   [DEL: dream :DEL] sleep, and no one would read my letter/post like tbh
   AM I A GHOST TO YOU?? I think I'm a wall or a non-existence creature in
   their life. If I need some advice or suggestions... even my parents...
   ughh!!
   They come to me and saw me doing something, and they said "wow, very
   good~" "awesome" when you clearly know that it's not that great or
   perfect (nothing is perfect, tho)... they only says good thing in front
   of you to please you (maybe because they liked you or maybe you're a
   son/daughter of a wealthy family or whatever).
   I don't know. Maybe I'm a bit emotional today.
   But Jk's recent fancafe update just... can I say that it was accurate??
   His post just hits me hard and at the same time, I'm agree with him. If
   you want us to scold you, I bet some won't. Nobody is perfect, but you
   can improve yourself to be better; not perfect. What have been you
   thinking in your mind right now recently? If you ask me, I thought
   about a lot of things, actually (but nobody will ask me, only me want
   to ask you).
   Does all people who born in September feel this? Because I got a feel
   that 6Jun does too.
   If this post made you think that I'm immature, then it's true. I don't
   think that I'm mature enough. I didn't talk with a lot of people so my
   understanding, my social skills, knowledge aren't that big/huge/wide.
   Still, if you want to scold or advice me, you are always open to do so.
   As long it wasn't because you hate me or just hate me or scolding me
   about something that I didn't do at all.
   I might legit crying again if jk wrote a little bit longer post [DEL:
   fk plss dont im tired of crying i dont like crying :DEL]
   These days, I've been wrote some long confessions in my diary and it
   means that I'm not in a good condition. I know myself better.
   Ah. creepy. Sorry for writing this. I'm frustrated, but I don't know
   how to ease it.
   [DEL: instead of studying history for tomorrow's exam, i'm writing this
   shit. wow even my discipline are not good for this. :DEL]
   [DEL:
   :DEL] [DEL:
   :DEL] btw, jk's fancafe update (20160202, 4:48am kst):

     Please scold me ARMYs, bring me back to my sense

   ‚ÄúShit la org yg buat sub lgu ni.. Ì†ΩÌ∏í‚Äù - N 00
   ‚Äúfuck org yg buat video nie !! pikiaq elok kot !!‚Äù - SS
   Sebenarnya takde mood nak marah ngan dua ekor manusia yang TAK PANDAI
   NAK BACA DESCRIPTION sebelum tengok video Misheard 'Bang Bang Bang' ni.
   Please get in into one's head about something that misheard lyrics are
   only for fun purposes, and the lyrics are only for jokes. Another
   thing, reading the description is a child's play for you, and I know
   you won't feel disgusted with my misheard videos if you read the
   description. LOL. YOU GOT NO JAMS, girls. Calm your s down.
   May you live a better life, especially for SS.

[76]20151111 : EXO - Lightsaber, Crying over an article, etc.

   Light Light Light Light Light...
   [77][exo-statwars-3.gif]
   [REVIEW] EXO - LIGHTSABER
   [78][cover.jpg]
   [SINGLE] EXO - LIGHTSABER
   Release Date: 2015.11.11
   Genre: Dance
   My Ratings: * * * *
   Download Link
   (MP3): [79]http://www.mediafire.com/download/dudtb16fbv8tdee/01.+LIGHTS
   ABER.mp3
   OH MY GOD! THIS SONG IS PERFECTION! The beat, I've never heard it from
   EXO! I would like if they release a song like this next time! I didn't
   expect anything LIKE THIS for the collaboration (sorry) but look at
   this! I just watched the teaser an hour before it was released, no
   knowing when the actual release date. An hour after it released, I look
   back at their YouTube Channel and found the MV and I calmly click at it
   and BOOM!!! For my amazement, I'd never expect the song would turn out
   this good! Oh wait, what did you expect from EXO, anyway? They're
   always went viral and their songs are always on the top of the charts.
   I hope they'll keep the success until FOREVER!
   Maybe I didn't expect anything because of their JAPANESE single album.
   Well, everyone have their own opinion. Ok, nvm.
   What disappoints me is XIUMIN ONLY GOT ONE LINE. THE FREAKING ONE LINE.
   That 'Lightsaber!' before the 1st chorus. His voice made me going crazy
   (in a good way) and I was excited to hear his other part but.... WHY?!
   His solo song 'You Are The One' really good and his voice is quiet
   good. He should shine more in other EXO songs in the future. XIUMIN, I
   really looking forward for you.
   The other thing is, the song is only for 2:27 minutes and it's too
   short! Even shorter than BIGBANG's BAE BAE! What... what... what's
   this? And the music video too, only Kai, Sehun and BAekhyun featured in
   it. BUT DAMN THEY SLAYED IT! Is that Sehun who rode the motorcycle??
   Sehun, you've grown (of course, plus that he's 21 now). Somehow, I
   forgot that they've once a 12-member group. Damn, 9 is enough! Bless
   the remaining, loyal members! Not that I hate the former member, but...
   it's all the past so let's MOVE ON.
   I'm happy that Sehun got some lines (is that even his voice? OMG so
   deep, so *kai~~)
   And Chanyeol's fast rap! Their talents are shining! I'm happy for them!
   Please, please, please continue that~!!
   NOTE:
   *kai: perfect. It's my own dictionary. Hahaha~~
   CRYING OVER AN ARTICLE.
   Ok. This might sounds weird, but yeah... I cried. I cried and I
   couldn't even read the article till the end. Is it an article or
   interview? Hahaha... but I think it's an interview article.
   An interview from E-POP Malay, 68th Issues (May 2015). Page 20-21.
   Now I clearly know since why I'm looking forward on RAP MONSTER even
   though I'm not an ARMY yet that time. Shockingly, I've read that before
   and I clearly couldn't remember anything (probably because I'm going
   crazy over EXO as the main focus in that magazine).
   I already know about his mixtape album that time but I forgot to
   download it (or try to listen to it). :(
   Fool me, fool me. I only remember about it on July... downloaded in on
   23rd July 2015.
   And his solo Music Videos, I thought it was last year's. But I figured
   out that it was this year's, in March. I'm too lazy to read the
   description. I can't believe that I've watched it several times as I
   watch another BTS' music videos (still not an ARMY yet that time)
   (uhh... but I didn't watch till the end the 'DO YOU' MV because it was
   a bit... you know... 'dangerous'). I thought "Cool~" "Wow~ His rap is
   perfectly awesome!" "This is my type" without even know what did he
   exactly says.
   Yup, that's true. I've known BTS since their debut. The first BTS
   performance that I've watched is No More Dream/We are Bulletproof Pt.2
   (I don't even remember which one but I think it's No More Dream bcuz of
   the abs). After being an ARMY, watching their BANGTAN BOMBS, then
   finally found their debut MVs, and I thought "Hey, I think I've seen
   this dance and song on TV before but... when?". And finally I
   remembered it was 2 years ago when I saw them on TV. I thought "Not
   bad. This song is good, but I've never heard this group name at all
   before" and "Ah! That dance (showing abs) reminds me of BIGBANG's LA LA
   LA dance!", but anyway... I quickly grabbed a pen and a paper and wrote
   down their GROUP NAME and the song name; to download the song, of
   course. But I don't know, I suddenly forgot about them and focusing on
   BIGBANG.
   It's pitiful that I even saw them on KBSWorld, they're having a talk
   idk but I saw their NO MORE DREAM m/v (cutted ver) and it was when
   they're promoting their DARK&WILD album, if I'm not mistaken (or SKOOL
   LUV AFFAIR album). That first impression, that (No More Dream) MV (when
   Jin get out from the bus), I thought that I've seen that somewhere but
   I don't remember. I can only recognize Jungkook, Suga, Jimin's face
   that time (not clearly remember the names but I still remember how they
   looks like that time, since KBS repeated the same clip from BTS after a
   few dramas/shows). Without even remembering that IT WAS THEM FROM LAST
   YEAR, I gave some interest on the group. The concept attracted me, the
   preview of their new song made me wanna hear more (but I don't remember
   which song it is). And once again, I forgot about them. Hahaha... It's
   actually not easy for me to stan a group.
   Then, last year, around July or August like that, my friend gave me a
   compilation videos of funny moments (incl. BTOB, BEAST, EXO, BTS, ect.
   I don't remember well since the video was ACCIDENTALLY deleted
   permanently on my pendrive). The video is hilariously funny and
   entertaining, but that one group, that one video, THAT TWO MEMBERS OF
   THE MALE GROUP KISSING ON THE LIPS really kills me and it shocks me too
   much and in my mind I don't think I will ever like THAT group at all
   (even though I found it funny af). Even though I found it creepy, I
   kept hitting the play button because I was addicted to the song in that
   video. It says... "Cuz we got fire, fire, fire! And higher, higher,
   higher!". The raps and the rhythm, it attracts me so much. I listen to
   it several times in a day. Really, really addicted to that song. So bad
   that I don't know that song name that time. Maybe because I was
   attracted more to D.O. & EXO that time, I don't even realize that it
   was BTS (plus that they dressed weirdly in that video. Hahaha!!).
   I went crazily over EXO and GD X TAEYANG during the school holiday. I
   downloaded a lot of songs from them including Luhan and Kris' solo
   songs.
   In the early of January, I finally decided to try to listen to other
   group's songs. I found the download link for the 'DANGER' MV, and I
   decided to download it. But I clicked the wrong link, and I downloaded
   the 'DANGER' MV, from TAEMIN!! I'm too lazy to re-download the right
   MV, and search up for another K-POP songs from the internet instead,
   but download nothing since the internet connection is lost.
   I've heard a lot about BTS, and one day I decided to try to hear one of
   their song (I don't know what's their song tittle so I just search 'BTS
   MP3' on the search engine) and finally found their songs on
   4shared.com. Well, not a song, but THE WHOLE ALBUM! I downloaded the
   'Danger' track, but not really impressed by it. Then, I downloaded the
   'War of Hormone' and I got really addicted to it. The third time I
   revisit that webpage, I downloaded ALL SONGS FROM THAT ALBUM. Really,
   really addicted. That's the first time I downloaded all songs from an
   album in a short time.
   When the school session starts, I starts getting close to one of my
   senior (actually, just a year older than me) and talked about K-POP.
   And unknowingly, I really want to talk about BTS, since she's already
   an ARMY that time. It's so fun! I wish to meet her again, but it seems
   impossible...
   Until I moved to a new school on 10th February, still not telling my
   close friend in Salaping about BTS, suddenly I ignored BTS once again.
   Focused on EXO, but when I heard that BTS released a new album, I
   quickly downloaded the whole album (I downloaded it but I didn't hear
   the songs from the album at all bcuz of EXO's comeback). Then I met a
   new friend, who's also an EXO-L and we became close (just bcuz of
   E-POP. Thanks, E-POP!). I found out that she's also an ARMY (and that
   time I also figured what kind of 'ARMY' the netizens talked about on
   FB). I heard their song, 'I NEED U', but since it's a slow song, I'm
   not interested at all.
   When BTS came to KK, my friend got crazy and I helped her to find any
   information about them in KK. I searched for some pictures and posted
   it to FB so that she can saw it too. (J-Hope is disturbingly funny that
   time, with that snakeu). Even though they came to KK, I don't fall to
   them easily. Well, at least I knew some of the member's names...
   Jungkook (I knew him even before the DANGER era, actually, due to his
   popularity), J-Hope, and when I heard about Rap Monster, I thought "I
   think I've heard his name before..." but I ignored it. It's actually an
   honor that they came to Kota Kinabalu, since usually foreigner idols
   only came to Kuala Lumpur for concerts or fanmeeting. They came to KK
   for a schedule, and 'rest, enjoying their holiday' at the same time.
   They even go to LOK KAWI! Somehow, I felt proud for Sabahan. Guys, you
   are very lucky to be a Sabahan! But what's sad is... the earthquake...
   It's the most scary moment (and exciting since I never feel it before)
   in my life!
   Just in May/June (I don't remember well), I finally decided to listen
   to all songs from the album. And damn, 'DOPE' sounds so good and it
   catches my attention! It's a waste that I didn't hear to it earlier.
   It's a jam along with 'Hold Me Tight', 'Converse High' and 'Fun Boyz'.
   Just then, BTS dropped official photo teasers for their upcoming
   comeback (and we really thought it was for Part 2 of their previous
   album). Rap Monster is the first one to be revealed, and since that I
   collected each member's till the end. No, the first one is the hand...
   but I ignore it till Rap Monster's teaser appeared. And guess what, by
   following the updates from their official Facebook Page (I don't know
   when did I liked the page, anyway), I learned about which one is this
   and that. I hated Rap Monster, because his face reminds me of someone
   that I don't like the most. And Jimin, because being too hot and
   popular. LOL. Even though he really looks so handsome and looks like GD
   in that teaser.
   I'm late for the new MV... but when I finally watch it, I thought "OMG!
   MY FAV SONG FROM THE ALBUM!" and get very hyped!! 'I Need U' is too
   emotional, but this 'DOPE' MV is energetic! The dance, the rhythm, the
   melody, the RAPS, Jimin's high note and Jin's voice... I THINK I'VE
   FINALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH THE GROUP! And shockingly, even though I hate
   Rap Monster, I suddenly went crazy over his raps (and voice in the
   beginning) among the other rappers. It's weird that I've fall into Rap
   Monster's charisma when Jungkook is the most popular member and Jin is
   the most handsome member, when Jimin is the hottest member, J-Hope is
   the cutest and hypest member and V is the most unique and have a very
   soulful voice, and Suga is also a very good and talented rapper and is
   very swag (which is my style)... but I didn't fall easily, though. I
   think it's all started after I watched them on Weekly Idol, Bangtan
   Bomb, and read the translations of their songs ESPECIALLY Rap Monster's
   rap.
   I finally figured out that Rap Monster is good in English, and I found
   out that he is good for my motivation to not give up. He is my
   inspiration! Even when I found out that he's a pervert but all that
   important for me is he makes me positive (except for that curses), he
   is a very responsible leader, and I could understand his feelings when
   he said life is getting hard, he felt like gave up, he felt so empty,
   etc. because I'm facing that too. He is a professional, I got a feeling
   I should learn something from him. His songs, mixtapes, gives me
   inspiration. It feels like I've finally found someone that can reflect
   me almost... perfectly, but not completely. I'll try to take only the
   good thing about him. He is a genius?? I don't care! Whether a genius
   or not, his maturity level of his mental (lol my words), his
   perspectives, the way he was thinking, his weird personality, anything
   positives from him... I take that as my inspiration.
   That's why... when I read the article,, I cried unknowingly, and only
   realize when my tear drop falls onto my lap. I can't describe it, but
   it's not sad, it's not amazing, it's not funny, it's not happy... it's
   an understanding feeling, I think. Whoever can understand what I feel,
   I hope we can talk to each other, discussing about our curiousness and
   doubts, finding the answers of all questions that's playing in our
   mind. I can't even read till the end of the interview, only 1 and a
   half page (not even a half, actually) and quickly close the magazine
   and swept my tears by using my blanket (cuz I couldn't find my
   handkerchief or tissues and blanket is the only thing that's close to
   my hand to reach). I'm not going to take a risk to cry. I can cry next
   time, but not now. It'll be obvious. Too obvious when I cry.
   That's why... since a long time ago, I dreamed of going to another
   place to learn. Same dream, but different reasons. Since I live with a
   perfect family, given all that I need, and mostly faced no problem at
   all, I wanted to feel how... how the others who lived unfortunately
   like me be like. I know, I would found an answer for that. Life is... A
   POOP. (lol. kidding.).Life is complicated, a journey, a learning
   process, a puzzle, a maze, a challenge, the time that God had given us
   to change to be better and faithful. And for me, life is a test. You
   failed, you learn from the past and try to pass in the future. It's
   complicated. It's subjective. Too much definitions. Too much
   speculations.
   To all this while, I wanted to thank to myself for being tough, for
   being positive and avoid all the negativity. To not get involved in bad
   things.
   This... is... the... first... time... I... cried... because... of...
   an... article.
   I'm being dramatic, right? Hahaha~~ I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be
   dramatic at all.

[98]20151031 : ASDFGHJKL!!

   It's November in a few minutes!! (I'm writing this on 11:43 pm, 31 Oct
   2015 just in case if I couldn't finish it before 1st November).

                 [99][tumblr_nwqih6Lhhu1t8bmhqo1_500.png]

   OH MY GOD. THIS IS THE BEST [DEL: NIGHT :DEL] DAY EVER!! 31 October..
   yeah, it's kinda bad day for me cuz it's the day when Juejue and all of
   KRK 2012-2014 batch students last meet (he moved!). And that's the same
   day as our 2 KRK 2013 party. He's... kinda secretive, thou. Yeah..
   hmm.. I don't wanna think about that day, it was sad & happy mixed up
   together. And me (and him) who's now not at Salaping anymore, I thought
   that we're going to be far and more separated away. ANYWAY. Ignore
   this. Hahaha... I don't really like reminiscing, actually. But yeah,
   today (specifically TONIGHT) there's a lot of good thangs happened
   (well, not really a lot but still).
   Even though it's kinda weird, happy, excited, sad, etc., I still
   grateful. If I didn't online today, I won't be able to chat with
   him/them. OH MY GOD! asdfghjkllkjhgfdftgyuiolkjhgfxcvbhjnc
   Serious. Ughh... my head is aching (is that the right word?) rn. And I
   REALLY REALLY NEED SOME SLEEP. Oh, btw... I just finished KIM SEOKJIN
   in his Halloween suit (it's a pumpkin!) fan art (but I haven't lining
   it yet), and those 3 guys (NOEH, JUE & ELD) sketching. It's an
   improvement that I drew more than one today (even though it's not 100%
   complete). I'm satisfied, I'm happy, and I wish I could wake up with a
   good mood in the next morning. Perhaps. Perhaps for that.

   [12191928_549919788505510_2475114543534678311_n.jpg]
   AND it's kinda sad that BTS delayed their comeback from OCTOBER to 30th
   November 2015 (at least they give us the exact date), iKON on 16
   November 2015, and ooh I heard WINNER is delaying as well? WHY??
   asdfghjkl but it's okay. I used to this and I know I can overcome these
   things. I need to study, by the way (next year is SPM). Good that Zico
   will have a comeback on 3rd Nov! Yeah, I'll wait! I really hope that I
   can download or hear all of their songs from their comeback albums!
   NOW, for fellow K-POP lovers... please kindly vote your fav artist
   at [103]http://mama.mwave.me/vote?siteCode=S21
   [104][wow%2B1%2B%2528edit%2529.jpg]
   [105][wow%2B%2528edit%2529.jpg]
   What the ... HOW CAN I EVER CHOOSE ONE?! THE TOP 3 GROUP, THO.!! WHAT
   THE WHAT THE WHAT THE...!!! Please let me curse and cuss for a moment.
   I haven't finished voting yet because of this! ahhhhhh!!!
   [106][wow%2B2%2B%2528edit%2529.jpg]
   The best new male artist also so hard to choose because I honestly had
   heard and downloaded ALL OF THEIR DEBUT ALBUM/S & SONGS and it's...
   uhh... why, god, why??? I'm not really a fan of SEVENTEEN & MONSTA X
   but their songs are all good (iKON's songs are good too!) I like
   N.Flying's "AWESOME" and UP10TION's "SO, DANGEROUS" is good too but it
   kinda have SUJU's vibe. Idk. hahaha... This is hard, really. I don't
   know who should I choose...
   MNet, y u do this to us???? *crying internally*
   One vote per day. I'm not going to vote everyday, tho. I can only vote
   until 23rd Nov cuz I'll fly to peninsular soon...
   Emotikon frown (that means no internet).
   Because I can't choose which one to choose, after a deep thoughts, I
   decided to vote iKON and BTS. It's okay if they not win any awards on
   MAMA, because there's probably another award ceremony (I hope so) and I
   know BTS is the best and they will win the award. They worked so hard
   this year and as an ARMY, I really appreciate that. A LOT! Thanks, BTS!
   I luv ya!
   But ohh yeah... I was kinda shocked because BTS isn't nominated for
   Best Dance Performance (I think it's the first time they hadn't!) bcuz
   the I Need U and DOPE danceu are pretty good! How can?? Ahh... I can't
   believe this! And it's weird that BIGBANG (the pic below speaks
   everything)...

         [107][12191188_1004153209606589_4996113109294395680_o.jpg]
                 This is not my pic! Source from [108]here.

   Not that I hate BIGBANG. I'm a V.I.P!! But the dance are always kinda
   disappointed?? But still good. Hahaha... turn out that I'm one of them
   who voted BIGBANG for Best Dance Performance Male Group category.
   Huhuhu~~
   So, I think that's all for now. I'll keep update soon (perhaps) and
   maybe change the header or bg or even theme (but I love this Blogger
   theme). If I got some time, I'll update a review.
   G'nite!!
