[3]My Move to France

   I have not been posting as regularly as I would have liked, I have had
   a lot going on recently.
   Things will be changing for me very soon, I will be re-locating to
   France where I have bought a small home. I live in rented accommodation
   here, and there is no way with our dysfunctional property market I
   could afford a home in the UK.
   I'm retiring from my profession of the last 40 plus years, I will have
   to earn some extra income in France, I cant afford complete retirement
   till I get my State Pension.
   I do hope to be able to spend more time on my Blog, and will be doing
   Video Blogging as well.
   All of course with a Left wing pro Corbyn message, I will be in another
   Country but I will keep up the fight against the Tories, and of course
   the Blairites who have done as much damage to the UK and are trying to
   destroy our Party.
   I will cover more of the reasons for my move another time, but it was
   essentially to give me some sort of security in my older years. I had
   none in the Private Rental Sector, and no other options open to me. It
   is a damning indictment on our “Property Market”, both rental and owner
   occupier, that the cost of the home I purchased in France, was equal to
   just over two and a half years rent in my current home.
   I think you call that sort of decision “a no brainer”. It was paid for
   with a pension release. I am happy its a wise move, my pension savings
   now benefit my retirement, rather than funding someone else’s.

[12]The current "Crisis" and the troublemakers.

   Here are a few thoughts on this never ending “Crisis” of the making of
   “Blairites”, “Progress members”, and self called “Social Democrats”.
   Firstly, an overwhelming majority of us voted to return our Party to
   its Socialist roots, 60% of us.
   We don’t for one minute think that such a change will just be accepted
   by the voters, we are not stupid, it will need to be sold to our
   supporters. There have been years of anti-Socialist rhetoric, not least
   from within our own Party, yet alone the Murdoch empire. Years of so
   called “Pragmatism” from within have robbed us of our identity. What of
   this “Pragmatic Middle of the Road approach”??? It's just an excuse, an
   excuse for taking the easy option, not rocking the boat, not being too
   different to anyone else, not sticking ones head above the parapet.
   It is needless to say VERY popular within the Westminster Bubble that
   is the PLP.
   They don’t want to rock the boat or do anything that might jeopardise
   their lovely cosy existence as MP's. It even extends to some
   Councillors.
   They declare that this approach is the only way, that Corbyn is
   “ruining the Party and must go”.
   The only “Party” being ruined is theirs. The jolly is over. You have to
   work for your keep now, you have to sell our new found principles to
   the voters. You WONT have the cosy support of the Murdoch empire as
   Blair did, you WONT have the comfort of easy going BBC presenters.
   You will have to work bloody hard to sell the future to the voters, to
   convince them there IS an alternative to the endless austerity the
   Blairites are so comfortable with.
   Is all this work too much for you?
   Are you more worried about loosing your cosy positions of power?
   Would you rather take the easy option and not rock the boat?
   Are you more concerned that your gravy train might come off the rails
   than with the people your supposed to represent?
   Guess what? You are lazy worthless politicians who have no place in
   this Party. We have found our purpose, the one we always had, to fight
   for ordinary working people, to take on the powerful and the rich. To
   better the lives of the little people, those the Tories despise,
   trample and exploit for their gain. THAT is the purpose of Labour.
   We are SUPPOSED to rock the boat, We are SUPPOSED to be radical, we are
   SUPPOSED to stick our heads above the parapet.
   It's called conviction, conviction in Socialism.
   So, the next time you hear someone say “Corbyn must go”, “we must take
   action against him”, or any other similar talk of Coups, think very
   hard.
   Why is the person making these statements doing this?
   And more to the point does anyone who constantly demands Corbyn's
   removal even belong in the Labour Party?
   Even if they don’t like him, they should get on with the job in hand
   and sell Labour to the voters.
   If they are not prepared to do this, the door is open.
   Please use it.

[21]Where Labour Lost its Way

                          Where Labour Lost its Way

   Under Blair we became obsessed with “Winning”.
   A sports team is ALL about winning, once you have won you have achieved
   the ultimate goal, there is no more for you to do.
   Managers will adapt the running of sports teams to win, change players,
   change tactics.
   That is exactly what “New Labour” did. It became ALL about winning, our
   politicians became “Managers”, and employed many unelected “advisor’s”
   to decide Party policy.
   But we are not a sports team, its not about some cup. We are a
   political party. We are supposed to change peoples lives for the
   better, not adopt certain policies just to make it easier to win.
   We should fight to convince people we are different, that we have real
   policies for real people. Even if that makes winning difficult in the
   eyes of “managers”.
   It is time we ditched “managers” who are only interested in the salary
   and the glory of winning. We need to become conviction politicians once
   more, people who strive to change the lives of others, not strive for
   themselves. We need selfless politicians, caring and honest
   politicians. That is how Labour wins. Labour wins when the People win,
   not a few self centred grandees. Political careers for careers sake,
   are immoral, selfish and not something that belongs in Labour. The
   voters want people interested in what they can give back, not how many
   millions they can earn from Politics.
   If Labour is to be a team that wins, that “Team” must comprise ALL our
   voters. The poor, the old, the young, the sick, the workers and the
   jobless.
   Not simply a handful of MP's and advisor’s, concerned only with their
   own comfortable futures.

[30]The Descent of our Leadership contest into the depths of Despair.

   I have recently been enraged by what is going on in our Party.
   I have regretfully been drawn into the open warfare which is tearing us
   apart.
   Why?
   Because something is very unjust with the way our Party is functioning,
   and especially with the way we choose our leader.
   The nominations for the leadership, are made solely by the
   Parliamentary Labour Party.
   This is very very wrong. It is undemocratic and it is tearing our Party
   apart.
   I invite everyone to read the following five questions, you may be
   familiar with them.
   1/ WHAT POWER HAVE YOU GOT?
   2/ WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM?
   3/ IN WHOSE INTERESTS DO YOU EXERCISE IT?
   4/ TO WHOM ARE YOU ACCOUNTABLE?
   5/ HOW CAN WE GET RID OF YOU?
   Now please apply these questions to our Shadow Cabinet and our Leaders.
   1/
   Firstly they have great power. They choose who sits in the Cabinet,
   Shadow or otherwise. At present they have sole control over who WE are
   permitted to vote for as Party Leader. By this virtue alone, they have
   SOLE AUTHORITY over determining who is in charge. We the members do
   not.
   2/
   They were given this power, after at some point being part of a
   democratic selection process where a local Party evaluated them and
   selected them to stand as a prospective Parliamentary Candidate.
   It is indeed very rare for a sitting MP to ever be de-selected other
   than for gross misconduct.
   So once standing as an MP they are there for the long term in many
   instances.
   3/
   Now we come to the awkward bit. In whose interests exactly ARE they
   exercising this power when it comes to choosing our leader? I will
   suggest it is certainly not in the interests of root and branch members
   or the electorate they represent . Our leadership, as with that of many
   Party’s, has slipped into a form of succession or inheritance. A bit
   like an old fashioned Company Boardroom, or a Club or Society of some
   sort. In these institutions it was customary for people on the board or
   committee, to “work their way up” and “serve their time”, until they
   were the next in line for the big chair. In modern times, even big
   company boardrooms have moved away from this, and will often bring in
   new talent to revive a failing business. Our MP's, by being in sole
   charge of who is permitted to stand for leader, are able to perpetuate
   a form of agreed succession between themselves. We the membership, are
   excluded from absolute choice of our leader.
   4/
   The next awkward bit. They are not really accountable to anyone. They
   choose their own leader (by selecting who WE can vote for), they choose
   their own positions and roles, and unless they loose a general election
   (as in the case of Ed Balls) are there till they choose to retire.
   5/
   Another awkward bit. As I said earlier, it is very rare indeed to
   replace a successful MP with a new candidate. It does happen, but it is
   obviously a very undesirable process for a local Branch, why after all
   replace someone who is winning elections with a possibly uncertain
   candidate. People do have voter loyalty to a sitting MP. Quite rightly
   if he is doing his job properly and representing them.
   Now we return to where we are and the leadership contest which is
   rapidly descending into a cross between some comical farce, and an
   episode of a soap opera where everyone is stabbing everyone else in the
   back.
   It is clear that the leadership selection process is not fit for
   purpose.
   It is obvious that there is a chasm between the wishes of the select
   few in the Shadow Cabinet, and those of the Membership. The correct
   path in this case is not open for debate. We are a Democratic Socialist
   Party. It is beyond all doubt that the vote of the Membership is the
   only correct way of selecting a leader. It is therefore completely
   unacceptable, that the Membership is not able to exercise complete
   control over the nominations for who appears on the ballot papers.
   What has happened, is that we have 3 very similar candidates, chosen by
   agreement of those in power, and one candidate who it seems, was
   begrudgingly put there to pacify calls for a more varied choice, and to
   prevent unrest amongst the membership. Some will of course, have
   nominated him because they believe it is the right thing to do for
   whatever reason.
   Now that candidate is proving to be the choice of the membership, and
   grass roots, there is outrage and derision that the “natural order of
   succession” has been challenged. All of these people would do well to
   remember that they once relied on convincing ordinary members like us,
   that they were worthy of being put on a ballot paper in a General
   Election or Bye Election.
   All of them respected our choice then, they courted our votes at
   hustings, and convinced us to give them a chance.
   Where has that respect gone now? We are “Loonies”, we need
   “transplants”, and we are suddenly treated with derision for exercising
   our democratic right as members to choose a leader.
   It is time that this sanitised selection of who we can vote for is
   ended. It is plainly vital that the Membership is allowed to nominate
   candidates for leadership. Those in the PLP must have no more say than
   a member working in a supermarket. One Member, One Vote.
   We must end this leadership selection by a Cabal of the powerful. Such
   a system belongs to our enemies, it is the Tory way. Had Jeremy Corbyn
   NOT received enough nominations, we would have a 3 way leadership
   contest between 3 very similar, agreed and sanitised candidates. Non of
   which are popular amongst either the grass roots membership, or the
   Labour voters whose job it is for the grass roots members to speak to
   every day.
   We need a change to how we do this, our leader must be chosen by ALL
   our members at every stage of the process. From nomination (via
   Primaries of many candidates if necessary) to a one member one vote
   final ballot. Only then do we have credibility, and only this will
   prevent ANY powerful faction from taking complete control of our
   Party’s leadership process.
   If we do not offer a transparently democratic choice to the rule by the
   1% offered by The Tories, we will never be a true and decent
   alternative to them. An we will become more like them every day until
   our Politics differ in name only, much like in the USA.
   One thing is certain.
   Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely
   The Labour Party must make this impossible within our ranks.
   All our leaders must be truly accountable on a regular basis.
   And removable by the Membership.

[39]Our Party stands at the doors of "The Last Chance Saloon".

   It has been some time since my last post, and much has changed.
   Our Country is now run by a Tory Government which is hell bent on
   further rapid implementation of its prime dogma, Austerity.
   This Austerity is based on a lie (in fact a stack of them), and it is
   sadly undeniably true, that the majority of our Parliamentary
   leadership have bought into this lie.
   Some with misgivings, some with as much enthusiasm as the Tories
   themselves.
   During my campaigning, I spoke to many voters, on the street and on
   doorsteps. Many of them were apathetic about voting at all, many were
   drawn to extremist Party’s. Young people were most adamant about one
   thing “your all the same”, I heard that so many times, as I know
   canvassers up and down the Country did. Not just from young first time
   voters, but pensioners as well.
   Where did we go wrong? Simple if you ask me. We WERE too similar.
   People had had 5 years of hurt, with the certainty of much more on the
   way. They did not want the prospect we offered of guess what?? More of
   the same, from a Party they used to look to as an alternative to the
   Tories.
   Yes we offered some good policies, and I fully supported Ed Miliband
   and still like the guy. But as for policies that stood out and set us
   apart? nowhere near enough of them, nor radical enough.
   Worse still I was ashamed to hear people in our own leadership
   announcing that as a Party “we did not seek to represent those on
   benefits”, that we “could not condone scrounging”, that there must be
   “change to the welfare system to make work pay”, that “hard working
   people” (I HATE that bloody phrase), were “fed up of spongers and
   scroungers”. This was not quotes from the Express or Mail, it was from
   supposed LABOUR Politicians. A Month or so later they were wringing
   their hands stabbing Ed in the back, and wondering why we lost, and of
   all things saying it was because we were “too far Left”. Farcical. They
   are only worried about their own careers.
   Can I beg to suggest to them, they THEY were to blame? To blame because
   we were not different enough. We did not offer any sort of structured
   ALTERNATIVE to Austerity, just more Austerity with a slightly different
   bias, “Tory-Lite” if you will.
   Why has this happened? Well there is an explanation of sorts in my
   opinion, here it is.
   Over recent years, the Tories, partly dragged by their UKIP Cousins,
   have moved very firmly to the Right in just about every way. Today’s
   Tory Party is a far more “Conservative” than ever, propped up and
   directed by the wishes of big business and lobby groups.
   There is within the Labour Party, a faction which has always stated
   erroneously in my belief, that we cant win Elections unless we appeal
   to “The Centre Ground”. Well, this is how that works, and why we are in
   this mess now.
   Our opposition moves firmly to the Right, the “Centre Ground” by
   definition follows them. So, we as a Party, in order to fill this
   Centre Ground, adopt policies and strategies which are themselves ever
   further to the Right. This benefits no-one but the Tories and their
   supporters, who can never really loose, as our policies are very
   similar in essence to theirs. By signing up to Austerity we do their
   job for them, and constrain our own ambitions in an ideological
   straight-jacket of their making.
   How do we defeat and counter this and offer policies that make us stand
   out as a viable alternative because we are different? We must reject
   the Tory Made Austerity. It benefits no-one but the wealthy. To do this
   we need a radical leadership.
   We have a Candidate for leader who can do this. His name is Jeremy
   Corbyn, he is standing on an Anti-Austerity platform.
   He is a radical, he is starkly different. He is proud to be a
   Socialist, and he is a champion of the poor, the unemployed, those on
   benefits, those in jobs, the disabled , and of the Working Class in
   general. He is feared by the Tories and their supporters.
   He is also feared by those in our own Party. The “Oxbridge Elite”
   cannot relate to him, nor can they relate to Socialism in general.
   There is good reason for this.
   I have stated before that many of our current leadership think and act
   the same as the Tories for good reason. Most were educated in the same
   Universities, by the same lecturers alongside the Tory Elite. Is it any
   wonder they think the same way, but with slightly different priorities?
   In the early days of our Party, our leaders came from the same World as
   our voters, many were Trade Union officials, men who had worked in
   factories alongside the Voters, men passionate about Socialism who
   dedicated their lives to fight for change. They were not university
   boys, they were not Economics, Law and Sociology graduates, yet they
   gave us the NHS and the employment rights, human rights and social
   structure, all things we take for granted, and that the Tories are so
   desperate to dismantle.
   We were different, we were radical and we offered true change, we won
   the trust of the voters and we innovated and educated and effected true
   change.
   We have stagnated more and more the further to the Right we have
   become. The more our leadership has become complacent to Austerity,
   even complicit in Austerity. Our leadership hopefuls have bought to far
   into the Tory dream, and cannot see the way forward. Many are either
   terrified to admit to being Socialists, or worse declare they are NOT
   Socialists. Many I am sure are not.
   To further Socialism is the prime reason The Labour Party exists, your
   membership card used to say this (Until Blair had it removed).
   Without this commitment to Socialism, this commitment to change, we are
   nothing. We are never going to inspire.
   Disenchanted voters are voting for radical alternatives, The Greens,
   and worse for UKIP, a far Right racist Party. And YES you are racist,
   most of your supporters are, I spoke to enough of them whilst
   canvassing and heard enough “I'm not a racist but” statements to last a
   lifetime. Working man has been set against working man on the basis of
   ethnicity in the cruellest con trick ever.
   Divide and Rule they call it. The Tories used it to build The Empire,
   now they are using it to control us here in Britain.
   We are as an effective Opposition Party, that can offer any sort of an
   alternative which will galvanise our core voters, staring into the
   doors of “The Last Chance Saloon”.
   We can go in one at a time, quietly and meekly, apologising for our
   once proud beliefs, and be gunned down by the Tory Big Boys.
   Or we can go in as one with the big guns of our once proud Socialist
   principles blasting Equality and Democracy for all, and an end to the
   unjust Austerity.
   We must win this fight, or we must fail with our boots on and our flags
   flying, not go meekly into an endless Tory future betrayed by our own.
   I am ready to kick the shutter doors open carrying the red flag of
   freedom, who will march into the last Chance Saloon with me???
   I know Jeremy Corbyn will.
   More to follow.

[48]Blair Again

   We are days away from one of our biggest defeats ever, and Blair is
   already saying that we lost as we were too far to the left and need to
   be "in the centre ground".
   This does not fit with my view of things. The SNP and the Greens both
   adopted an Anti-Austerity stance, and grew their vote. The SNP
   destroyed us in Scotland and contributed largely to our collapse.
   Whilst the Greens don’t have huge numbers of MP's, they drew an
   increased vote and undoubtedly hurt us by stealing votes from
   youngsters we needed to vote for us in order to win.
   Locally here in Christchurch they hurt us in the local elections,
   pushing us into third place behind UKIP in a ward we should have won.
   Now Blair is telling us we need to be more lilly livered than we
   already are.
   He is wrong.
   For many we were simply not different enough to The Tories, not radical
   enough.
   Our version of "Austerity-Lite" did not appeal. People have had enough
   of bearing the brunt whilst they saw Millionaires get tax cuts
   (assuming they paid ANY in the first place). Whilst they were hit with
   cuts, pain and a never ending assault by the Coalition. WE were just
   not seen to have offered a clear enough alternative, allthough we in
   reality, were very different.
   So Mr Blair, if you take control of this Party again, with your
   Neo-Liberal pink Tory claptrap, I will resign from it.
   If you do so, I sincerely hope that the Unions pull all Labours funding
   and start a new party.
   One with decent Socialist principles, one that has something like the
   "Clause 4" that you removed from Labour. That party SHOULD be Labour,
   there are many like me who will resist any attempt by the Blairites to
   take control of our Party, with all our might and to the last breath.
   But rest assured, if you do, many like me will resign, and we will form
   a new Party. We don’t want to believe me, we all fully believe that it
   is Labours job to win this fight against the Tories. But if you turn
   our proud Socialist Party into some sort of pink Neo-Liberal apology
   for the Party we should be, we WILL go.
   I hope that this nightmare from our past disappears where he belongs,
   in the dustbin of history.
   Go Away Mr Blair! and take your Progress chums with you.
   Go and join the Lib-Dems, they need some new lilly livered supporters.

[57]Post 7th of May

   We sit currently, nursing ourselves from one of the biggest and
   unexpected defeats ever.
   Th Nation sits under the rule of one of the most Right Wing, cruel and
   oppressive Tory regimes in modern history. One that would be
   unimaginable in its severity even to Margaret Thatcher.
   I have just posted these words on our facebook page, they are my own
   personal view.
   Here we go, the BBC are now saying (quoting Alan Johnson) that "its a
   10 year job for Labour to rebuild".
   We DONT HAVE 10 ******* YEARS. The poor, the disabled, the sick, the
   old, any one who is just a bit different cant wait that long.
   The Country will be nearly destroyed after 5, after 10 don’t even
   bother getting out of bed to challenge it, just march straight to the
   nearest poor house if your not too bloody sick or old.
   If we don’t get our act together now, and put up a valid and radical
   alternative, one that is SO different it cant be mistaken, we are
   wasting our time.
   Now if ever, is the time to bring back "Clause 4" of our once proud
   constitution.
   Clause 4 (as was)
   "To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their
   industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be
   possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of
   production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system
   of popular administration and control of each industry of service."
   We ditched this in 1995, under the leadership of one Tony (Tory
   Bastard) Blair. A socialist he was not.
   Time to bring it back?
   If we cant be radical, cant be different, and cant offer hope to the
   weak.
   What the hell is the bloody point???
   If you are obviously radical, obviously different, it is damn difficult
   for your opposition to deceive people as to your intentions. Your true
   motives can be seen and understood. It is time for us to have true
   conviction once more. We cant go on being " Tory-Lite" any more. We are
   not "Neo-Liberals".
   If we are not going to be proper decent Socialists, with a
   democratically elected through the ballot box revolutionary agenda.
   Why do we exist??????
   The statement I am making is this. The Labour Party was founded as a
   Revolutionary Socialist Party, who believed in change through the
   democratic process.
   It was via this belief, that our greatest achievements, such as the
   NHS, and the Welfare State were founded. These beliefs also inspired
   our principles of equality and justice, our hatred of prejudice of all
   forms, and were why we campaigned and achieved decent Human Rights
   legislation.
   All of this is in disarray and at risk of loss in the next 5 Years.
   I truly believe we need to re-visit Clause 4, and incorporate a modern
   re-written version into our constitution.
   The Daily Mail and Murdochs finest will squeal in horror. Good, that
   means we have it right.
   The time for appeasement is over, the time for being moderate is long
   gone, our opponents are certainly not moderate, and nor can we be if we
   hope to offer an alternative.
   No More Mr Nice Guy.
   It is time we are plain and clear what we stand for and what we offer
   the voters.
   If we dont, as I said.
   Why do we exist??? Simply to offer jobs to politicians who don’t want
   to be Tories but are too scared to be real Socialists?
   There is a party for people like that.
   Its called The Liberals.

          untold harm to future Generations. It is my mission to help
          prepare those generations to take up the fight against the
