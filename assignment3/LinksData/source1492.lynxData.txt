[9]Best Mountain Biking Trail in Bali – Downhill Cycling from Mount Batur to
Ubud
       Love the phonetic spelling in Bali
       Who’s ready for some downhill?
       And we’re off!
       I think I’ve mastered selfie taking and cycling one handed
       You see road side fruit stalls like this all over SE Asia
       Photo taking begins
       Downhill all the way
       Passing into a new province
       Heading thru town
       Past typical Balinese homes
       And temples
       Half the traffic is these vans ferrying tourists
       Into the next province
       Getting misty now
       Running to get out of the rain
       Thankfully our guides packed rain ponchos
       Getting soaked but loving every minute
       Balinese women have some impressive neck muscles
       Visibility down to about 20 metres
       Didnt I pass you earlier?
       Small accident when a bike swerved in front. She was okay after
       resting in the support van
       They go to school 6 days a week in Bal, thankfully for them just
       half days
       The rain wont deter this lady getting her cargo to where it needs
       to be
       The trail restarts
       Along with the photo taking
       Heading into an off road section
       Small lumber yard
       Why’ve we stopped?
       Brief break to check out this roadside carpentry workshop
       Beautiful countryside on this trip
       Now heading past rice fields
       Setting the pace
       The first hill…and we all walked
       Through the jungle
       Quite an impressive temple on this corner
       At least the rain is good for the crops..I think
       The rice fields have an irrigation system that feeds water to the
       ones below
       Backbreaking work
       You see these statues everywhere
       Now heading through town
       Schools out! Until Monday:(
       All the kids wave as we passed.
       Good setting for Game of Thrones
       The palace where the President stays when in Bali
       Heading through another Balinese town
       More rice fields
       Brief photo stop
       Today’s cycling troop
       Locals are always happy for us to take their picture
       Hill number 2. Walked section no 2.
       The guide showed us around an authentic Balinese home
       This is their private temple
       Our group was more interested in photographing the kids
       They didnt seem to mind having their home invaded by tourists
       And chasing the livestock
       Quick before it escapes!
       On the final section now
       Anyone read Balinese?
       Last stop – A cock fighting stadium
       This has to be one the easiest and most varied downhill mountain
       bike trail I’ve ever done.
       The trail begins at Mount Batur, Bali, with breakfast looking
       across at the 2,000 metre mountain I’d trekked up for sunrise the
       previous Sunday. Unfortunately it was too misty to properly see the
       mountain, as I did this trail in February, in the midst
       of Bali’s rainy season.
       After breakfast the mountain bike trail begun, which would take us
       downhill virtually the entire way on the 35km back to Ubud.
       Literally, you hardly have to pedal and just need to use the
       breaks, so anyone can do this no matter how daunting the distance
       might sound.
       This mountain bike trail takes you through forests, towns rice
       fields, past temples and you even get invited to look around a
       Balinese house, or should I say compound. Families stick together
       in Bali, and children continue to live in the same compound as
       their parents even when they’ve grown up, with the whole family
       sharing their own private Hindu temple.
       This is one of the best mountain bike trails in Bali – it’s easy on
       the thighs and the eyes with beautiful countryside and rice paddies
       surrounding you nearly the entire way. There’s no shortage of
       companies that offer this trail, and being Bali you’re looking at
       30 USD or less for the whole day. So an absolute bargain to boot!

[15]Best Mountain Biking Trails in Cyprus – One Brutal Hill and a Hidden Dam
       Wheels for the weekend – an Orange Gringo
       Handy cycling path through Lakki
       Brief stop at the beach
       End of the road (and EU funding:)
       Heading out of Lakki
       This is where I should have kept going, and not turned rigth
       “What happens in Paradise stays in Paradise”
       Mountain range in distance, which I would soon be climbing to the
       top of
       Wrong turn into a caravan park
       Along north coast Akamas park, dirt trak for next 10km
       Open sea on the right
       Now heading down some trails through the park
       Time for some downhill
       Didnt see any other mountain bikers, but plenty of quad bikes
       Whoever abandoned this car had a long walk back
       Time for some brutal uphill climbing
       Up and up as far as you can see
       Finally! Time to head back down
       Cliffside path snaking its way around the mountains
       Make sure I go right way this time
       Through Neo Chorio parkland
       Back to civilisation
       Day 2 – Heading East to Makounta park
       Hope the mountain in background isnt as steep as yesterday’s
       Looking over Argaka village
       Stopping to double check I go the right way
       Entrance to the park with a circular trail that passes Argaka dam
       Awesome trail that winds all the way around the valley
       Quick selfie
       Pretty flat once you’re at the top
       Wrong turn again
       I found a police car burial ground, but no dam
       Heading back to Polis
       This summer I was lucky enough to be in Cyprus for my brother’s
       wedding combined with my Dad’s birthday, so decided to take full
       advantage and check out Cyprus’ best mountain bike trails. After
       some research, Polis appeared to be the place to go, which is a
       small town in the north (Greek side) close to Akamas national park.
       This area of Cyprus is billed as a mountain bikers’ paradise, with
       loads of trails throughout the park and surrounding countryside.
       I rented an Orange Gringo from [16]Wheelie Cyprus who kindly
       delivered it to where I was staying, along with a kit bag with
       lock, puncture repair kit, map, helmet and gloves. They even offer
       an emergency pickup service, which is ideal if, like me, you’re
       going mountain biking on your own. Thankfully, I didnt need it, but
       always good to have that reassurance should you have an accident.
       Day one I decided to tackle the mountain bike trails around Akamas
       park. Word of warning – if you ever go on this trail, whatever you
       do, make sure you take the trail through Neo Chorio and around the
       south side. I took a right turning too early and after a pleasant
       hour or so cycling along the northern coast I had to make a brutal
       ascent up the mountain. I had to push the bike up a lot of it and
       took a few breaks, and it took me over an hour to get to the top.
       At least I could enjoy just sitting and enjoying the scenary on a
       rapid descent the other side.
       Akamas park is packed with wide, open mountain bike trails along
       dirt tracks and through parkland, and there’s literally no traffic
       (cars or people). Just make sure you go round from the south:)
       Day two I headed along the coast east to check out a Cyprus
       mountain bike trail around Argaka park for a circular trail past a
       dam. There was some uphill climbing to get to the park, but nothing
       too daunting compared to the previous day. Once you get to park
       there’s a mountain bike trail that winds all the way through the
       valley. I didnt find the dam, but had a great time bombing around
       the cliffside paths nonetheless.
       So if you’re thinking of doing some cycling on the island, head to
       Polis in the north for the best mountain bike trails in Cyprus.

       Tags: Best Mountain Biking Trail in Prague

[20]Best Mountain Biking Trail in Prague alongside the river
       Within 5 mins of leaving the city centre of Prague we’re in
       countryside
       No cars. Awesome!
       This mountain bike trail follows a long path next to Prague’s river
       Better keep right
       I think it’s about time I bought a new cycling shirt!
       Not many people out today
       Time for the river crossing
       Very popular stop off for cyclists
       Time to pay the ferryman
       My guide for the day, Peter
       Think I’ve put on weight since leaving Asia?
       Now for the second leg
       A brief stop while Peter tries cycling through a river
       Will he make it?
       No
       At least you didnt fall in
       Single track mountain biking trail
       Up a steep hill
       Back on the main road
       Which way is it back to Prague?
       You can see Prague castle in the far distance
       Time for the downhill mountain biking section now
       Still not much traffic
       Now we’re back on the right side of the river
       Through a huge park to the north of Prague
       Selfie time
       Looking back towards the north of Prague to where we came from
       During the summer I thought I’d check out Prague in the Czech
       Republic, central Europe. I was lucky enough to make contact with a
       local via Meetup.com to show me a mountain biking trail alongside
       Prague’s river. The total trip was only about 30km, but featured a
       variety of terrain, from cycle paths to single lane trails through
       the woods and steep downhill section on the main road back into
       Prague.
       If you’re ever in Prague, I recommend renting a mountain bike and
       exploring the cycle paths around the outskirts of the city. It only
       takes 5 minutes to escape the city centre and out enjoying the
       surrounding countryside. There’s also a couple of Facebook groups
       for cyclists if you want to find some local cycle buddies to show
       you the best mountain bike trails around Prague.

[26]Mountain Bike trail in Bangkok – Narrow Streets, Markets and into the
Lungs of the City
       At the start of our trek through Bangkok
       Starts on the streets
       Which start getting narrower
       Are we supposed to be going this way?
       Heading through a market
       Hope we dont lose our guide
       Where did he go?
       You guys seen him?
       There he is
       Crossing over old railway
       Creating our own cycle lane
       Quick break
       Waiting for our boat over the river
       All loaded
       Heading towards ‘lungs of Bangkok’
       Restarting our trek on the other side
       Now heading into countryside
       Convenient raised platform through the forest
       Perfect for cycling on
       This criss crosses all over the island
       You need to be careful you dont fall off though
       Who can jump the highest?
       Feeding the ducks in the park
       Proper forest paths now
       Time for lunch
       This was our chef (the older guy, I mean)
       Time to head home
       Through another market
       Empty this time
       Back on the main road back to the start
       This mountain bike trek took me through narrow streets of Bangkok,
       so narrow people literally had to jump out of the way to let us
       past. But, as always in Thailand, everyone was very accommodating,
       and I got the impression they’re used to seeing these mountain bike
       tours of foreigners coming through their local market. We actually
       managed to lose our guide at one point so had to stop and wait for
       him to come back and rescue us.
       What’s more, this mountain bike trail in Bangkok includes a boat
       trip over to the ‘lungs of Bangkok’. This island offers an escape
       from the city for the locals, with lots of forests and parkland to
       explore. So you get a bit of everything on this trip and you really
       do get to see the authentic side of Bangkok on this mountain bike
       trek, which takes you through the backstreets and areas you’d never
       imagine visiting on your own.
       This mountain bike trail in Bangkok was done with [27]Follow Me
       Bike Tours. The bikes were in great condition, the guide was
       friendly and helpful and the lunch was absolutely delicious
       (pedaling 40km is always a great way to build an appetite!). So if
       you’re in Bangkok and fancy doing something more adventurous than
       shopping and visiting temples, I highly recommend going on this
       mountain bike trail with Follow Me.
       When I first saw  this video I thought they couldnt be serious
       about taking us down these streets!

                Xuan Huong Lake

       After a month in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, I headed to De Lat to check
       out some of the mountain bike trails in Vietnam. This trip was
       with  Vietchallenge and was their [56]Northern Challenge tour. It
       covers about 32km through beautiful pine forests and countryside,
       past the Xuan Huong Lake and then finishing in a local Vietnamese
       village where they sell handicrafts.
       There is a lot of uphill and the roads are still in the process of
       being built, so the terrain was pretty rocky in parts. But if you
       enjoy a challenge and like to push yourself, then I highly
       recommend checking out this mountain bike trail if you’re ever in
       Delat, Vietnam. There’s hardly any traffic and mountain biking
       through unspolit Vietnamese countryside offers lots of Kodak
       moments.
       If you’re feeling adventurous, you should also try ‘[57]canyoning‘.
       This is where you abseil down waterfalls and is a ‘must do’ for
       many backpackers and is what draws many of them to Dalat. There’s
       also come cliffjumping at the end to keep all adrenaline junkies
       happy.

[64]Temple Mountain Biking Trail at Angkor Wat, Cambodia
       Our guide leading the way towards Angkor Wat
       Mountain biking trek begins with gentle ride around the moat
       Main entrance to Angkor Thom in background
       Taking a break on top of the walls surrounding the temple complex
       Giant mountain bikes were very well maintined. Like brand new
       This mountain biking trek even takes you through an authentic
       Cambodian village
       The village school
       Looks like last lesson was maths
       Like being on set for Indiana Jones
       Network of quiet offroad trails linked all the temples
       Now at the Bayon temple
       Decorated with 100s of stone heads
       Bayon temple
       Lunch time
       Entrance to Ta Nei temple, this one was huge
       Our guide gave us lots of info on the way round
       A tree that’s planted its roots in the erock
       Broken through the roof to the round below, or is it the other way
       round?
       A shrine to ancient Khmar Queen
       This is where the Khmar kings would greet guests
       Building on the left was the library
       Local Cambodians looking to make a living from the increase in
       tourism
       Preah Khan temple
       Thats a lot of steps
       Buddhist shrine at the top
       Local Cambodian girls trying to sell us postcards
       We didnt buy any, so they sang to us instead
       The [65]Angkor Wat temples are a must on any trip to Cambodia. This
       incredible temple complex, whose name literally translates to ‘City
       of Temples’ dates  to the 12th century. It is the largest religious
       monument in the world. First built for Hindu then Buddhist worship
       during the time of the Khmer Empire, the temples span a huge area.
       So rather than go on foot or in the back of a tuk tuk, I decided to
       do some mountain biking around the temples.
       There are a few companies to choose from, but I opted for the
       [66]KKO’s (Khmar for Khmar Organisation) organised mountain biking
       trail. The main reason was because the money goes towards
       supporting 250 local people in gaining valuable skills, like
       speaking English or learning to become a mechanic, so they can find
       work and raise the general community out of poverty.
       This mountain bike trail took us on a 40 km loop around 5 temples,
       namely Bayon, Ta Nei, Preah Khan, Prasat Chung and Bantang Kdei.
       While we didnt go to Angkor Wat itself, I visited this on sunrise
       on another occasion. We covered a lot of ground, but you really
       need three days to see the temples properly and fully appreciate
       the history behind what you’re seeing.
       Our guide was very informative, you get taken to some places most
       tourists don’t see and the bikes were in excellent condition, so I
       highly recommend checking out [67]KKO’s website if you’re looking
       to do a mountain bike trail around Angkor Wat, Cambodia.

       While on a 10 day visit to Luang Prabang in Laos, checking out the
       local mountain biking trail was a priority. I did a guided tour
       with [99]Tiger Trail Laos covering 60km from Luang Prabang and
       around a great loop through the countryside. As you can imagine,
       the scenery was breathtaking, with hardly any traffic
       and surrounded by the unspoiled countryside of Laos. People were
       also very friendly, with children running out from their homes to
       shout ‘Sa Ba Dee!’ (hello) as we cycled past. Lets hope this
       friendly sentiment continues because Luang Prabang is undergoing
       some rapid changes now that tourism has arrived.
       If you’re ever in Laos, I highly recommend going on some mountain
       biking trails while you’re there. My big regret was not cycling to
       the popular waterfall because I was worried I’d get lost without a
       guide. Turns out it’s more or less a straight road all the way.
       I hope to go to Laos again some day and try out some of the
       mountain biking trails around the[100] Plain of Jars. Maybe next
       year…

       The beauty of mountain biking around Chiang Mai, Thailand, is that
       it’s flat as a pancake. What’s more there’s a route you can take
       from the south of the city which takes you along country lanes all
       the way with barely any traffic. On this trip I went cycling
       through forests and past rice fields on a scenic mountain bike
       trail around the temples and remnants of Wiang Kum Kam, the old
       capital of the Chiang Mai province. As I hope the photos show, it
       was an exceptionally picturesque mountain bike trail with lots to
       see and a great way to escape the crowds to do some truly authentic
       sight seeing.

[149]Doi Suthep, Mountain Biking Downhill in Chiang Mai, Thailand
       After a long, windy drive, we arrived at the top
       Unpacking the mountain bikes
       Checking the breaks
       Mountain biking down Doi Suthep, Chiang Mai, Thailand
       Coffee break
       Soaked, but loving every minute
       Taking a break to get some mud off
       Who’s having a good time?
       Was it left or right?
       Fellow riders and our guide in the middle
       My first mountain biking induced stiches
       This was my first experience of downhill mountain biking and it was
       certainly a case of baptism by fire, or rather rainwater. After
       checking in at [150]Mountain Biking Chiang Mai, we were taken up to
       the top of Doi Suthep by taxi, or Song Thau as they’re called in
       Thailand. We started in glorious sunshine but it poured it down for
       the 40mins or so it took to get to the top. After unloading the
       bikes and doing a quick proficiency test, which involved showing we
       could cycle over a log, it was time to hit the very skiddy slopes.
       I later discovered that under these conditions I should have got a
       bike with disc brakes. Unfortunately I had the normal rubber
       brakes, which werent much use on the mud slicks we had to cycle
       down. With the brakes largely ineffective, it was feet down most of
       the way on this muddy mountain bike trail, although there were some
       intermittent dry parts to have some fun on.
       My confidence wasnt too high at this stage, being my first time
       downhill, which I think contributed to the number of times I fell
       off. I was fully padded up though and can handle a few bumps. It
       wasnt until I got to the bottom though that I noticed that I had a
       big gash in my leg just before going through a quick dip in the
       lake where the ride ends. Thankfully we had a doctor in our group
       who recommended I get stitched up, leading to my first mountain
       bike induced scar.
       Despite the muddy conditions, I had a great time, and this just fed
       my enthusiasm for mountain biking and seeing what other trails are
       out there. with a variety of mountain bike trails to choose from,
       with the full range of skill levels, I recommend checking this out
       if you want to do any downhill mountain biking when in Chiang Mai,
       Thailand.
