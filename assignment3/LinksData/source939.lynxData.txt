   criminal justice in Scotland

[9]Quite possibly the last post

   2015 September 14
   Comments Off on Quite possibly the last post
   by Mary Munro

   Mary Munro I started this project back in October 2003 when online
   information about Scottish criminal justice was sparse and difficult to
   access.

   CjScotland was encumbered with all manner of ambitions but there was no
   way of knowing then that social media and the taken-for-granted online
   presence of government, agencies and organisations would evolve as they
   have done. There was also no way of anticipating how the political talk
   about justice would change, in this jurisdiction at least, to a much
   more nuanced and progressive approach, albeit that there are still
   arguments to be won and the talk has not as yet been translated into
   substantial and irreversible change.

   In recent years my energies have been diverted by teaching, book
   editing (see below) and my (voluntary) role as managing editor of the
   [10]Scottish Justice Matters project. Inevitably this blog became
   neglected and so the time has come to make it clear, in case anyone
   stumbles on this pages, that there isn’t going to be another update.

   CjScotland will continue to develop on [11]Twitter with media and
   source links to news and information about criminal justice in
   Scotland.

   If you would like to read more about Scottish criminal justice in book
   form then have a look at [12]Crime, Justice and Sociey in Scotland eds.
   Hazel Croall, Gerry Mooney and Mary Munro, Routledge (August 2015) and
   it predecessor, complementary volume, [13]Criminal Justice in Scotland
   Willan (2010).

   Best wishes

     Government in 1993 and left in place by the Labour and Liberal
     Democrat coalition here at Holyrood. It does not command public
     confidence.

     We are now in a position to end automatic early release for sexual
     offenders who are sentenced to more than four years and for serious
     violent offenders. That follows the work to stabilise the prison
     population and then reduce it over time by implementing other
     recommendations of the McLeish commission, such as introducing
     strong community-based sentences for less serious offenders. Further
     steps will follow as we continue the successful implementation of
