[8]ISIL ‘losing appeal’ in Iraq, but threat should not be underestimated – UN
envoy

   Iraq has been steadily gaining ground against the Islamic State of Iraq
   and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh), which is gradually losing
   its appeal to the disenfranchised population, the United Nations envoy
   for that country told the Security Council, as he also warned that its
   threat should not be underestimated.
   [9][iraqi%2Bchild.jpg] Briefing the 15-nation body, the Special
   Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Jan Kubiš, said the
   liberation and holding of Beiji, Sinjar, and most of all Ramadi, and
   continuing clearance of the surrounding areas from ISIL fighters, have
   instilled the people of Iraq with hope that the country can and will be
   liberated from ISIL.
   The success also demonstrates the increasingly resolute and effective
   support to Iraq of the global coalition to counter ISIL and provides
   lessons for preparations to liberate the remaining territories, most
   notably of Mosul, he said.
   Turning to the issue of Turkish forces present in Camp Bashiqa,
   mutually acceptable results have not been achieved so far, he said,
   reiterating the calls made by the Secretary-General for a solution in
   full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq – the
   principles set forth in the UN Charter.
   Pointing to an absence of political consensus, Mr. Kubiš said the
   stability, security and unity of Iraq hinge on an effective and
   inclusive political system and equality in decision-making at the
   federal and local levels. Tangible solutions must include amendments to
   or adoption of priority legislation, followed by swift implementation,
   such as the Accountability and Justice Law, the National Guard Law and
   the General Amnesty Law.
   Full and equal participation of the Sunni component in, and its
   co-ownership of, the national reconciliation programme is still a
   challenge, he said. The absence of a single framework or vision for
   national reconciliation in Iraq is both symptomatic of long-existing
   problems and further impedes efforts to advance inclusive national and
   community dialogue and historic compromise.
   Efforts by Sunni political forces and their leaders to unify their
   stance on national reconciliation, effective federalisation and
   decentralisation, and how to more successfully counter ISIL are equally
   necessary, he added. The UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), which
   Mr. Kubiš heads, organized a series of events earlier this month to
   mark World Interfaith Harmony Week in Najaf, Baghdad and Erbil.
   The events promoted dialogue on preventative steps to address drivers
   of violent extremism, in consonance with the United Nations Plan of
   Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. Turning to the safe return of the
   internally displaced persons (IDPs), he emphasized that the
   stabilization phase of Tikrit is almost complete, with 90 per cent of
   its population, or 167,000 people, have now returned home.
   So far, more than 500,000 displaced Iraqis have returned to their home
   communities. The Government intends that up to 900,000 will return in
   2016, despite several complicated factors, such as a huge number of
   improvised explosive devices (IEDs) laid by ISIL, as well as
   devastating destruction to infrastructure and homes.
   Iraq’s persistent and rapidly-deepening fiscal crisis and growing
   budget deficit, compounded by the security and humanitarian situation
   and drastic decline in global oil prices, has almost halved the State’s
   planned income since then, and the Kurdistan Region faces at least a
   situation as grave as that of Baghdad, he noted.
   If left unaddressed, such an unsustainable situation may seriously
   undermine the renewed morale of pro-government forces and confidence of
   the people, including youths, communities, minorities and IDPs that
   they can have a future in Iraq, he added.
   On the human rights front, Mr. Kubiš supported the calls of the Human
   Rights Council, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Special
   Advisor to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, that
   Iraq should consider becoming a Party to the Rome Statute of the
   International Criminal Court and to the Additional Protocol II to the
   Geneva Conventions 1949, and that the Iraqi criminal code be amended to
   grant Iraqi courts the jurisdiction to deal with international crimes.
   The humanitarian crisis in Iraq is highly complex, and is expected to
   widen and worsen this year. Today not only 3.3 million IDPs, but
   altogether some 10 million Iraqis – almost one third of the population
   – urgently require some form of humanitarian assistance, he said.
   Concluding his remarks, he informed the Security Council of the news
   that Amer al-Kaissy, UNAMI's liaison officer abducted in April 2015 in
   Diyala, was found dead, strongly urging the Iraqi authorities to
   conduct immediately a thorough and transparent investigation into this
   abduction and murder and hold the perpetrators accountable.
   In a [10]statement, the Secretary-General condemned the “shocking
   murder,” verified on 15 February, and expressed his condolences to his
   family and friends.

[19]After 25 Years of U.S. Role in Iraq, Scars Are Too Stubborn to Fade

   It was once a well-kept memorial for hundreds of Iraqi civilians who
   were killed by American bombs while they slept, a powerful symbol of
   suffering embraced by a dictator’s propaganda machine. The destruction
   of the Amiriya bomb shelter, in a middle-class Baghdad neighborhood, on
   Feb. 13, 1991, at the outset of the Persian Gulf war, killed some 408
   civilians in the worst way possible: Most were burned alive.
   It stands as the deadliest episode of civilian casualties in the
   painful history, now a quarter-century long, of the United States in
   Iraq. For years, Saddam Hussein ensured that the event remained etched
   in the Iraqi collective memory, recalled in movies, songs, poems and
   ceremonies. The shelter was a required stop for visiting dignitaries
   and foreign correspondents in Mr. Hussein’s tightly controlled Iraq.
   [20][amiriya%2Bmassacre.jpg] This week, 25 years later, the anniversary
   passed with almost no notice. An Iraqi Army unit now occupies the
   grounds of the shelter. The site is no longer open to the public,
   although the occasional survivors or family members of the dead are
   welcomed by soldiers and given tours. A few days ago, on the
   anniversary, two men from the neighborhood, now in their 60s, greeted a
   reporter and spoke about their memories.
   Each had lost several family members in the attack, and each had helped
   pile the charred bodies on trucks. One of the men, Hussein Abdella, 63,
   a retired truck driver, pointed to the neglected gravestones, chipped
   and overgrown with weeds and wildflowers, and said: “These are just
   names. There are no bodies buried here. They were all burnt. You could
   not recognize the bodies.”
   Shorn of its political purpose, the building itself is now a sad and
   neglected time capsule. The structure remains just as the American
   bunker-busting bombs left it, a scar on a cityscape that remains
   disfigured, too, by strikes from the opening of the 2003 war. There is
   a giant hole in the roof, a giant crater in the earth and a gnarled
   mess of wires and protruding steel rods.
   In dark corners down below are the dusty remnants of what the place
   once meant — and still does to some degree — to the Iraqi nation:
   black-and-white photos of the victims, arranged by family, fastened to
   poster boards but no longer hanging from the walls. Many of those
   pictured are small children: Hussein Alaa Ibrahim and his sister,
   Samah; Faras Khadim Abbas and his brother Amjid; Karrar Talib and his
   sister Hadeel.
   There is a tattered poster from the second anniversary of the bombing,
   bearing Mr. Hussein’s face and the words, “Allegiance and Challenge:
   The Second Anniversary of the Immortal Mother of Battles.”
   For the two neighborhood men, the anniversary of the shelter bombing
   was an occasion for reflection on a stark milestone: The gulf war began
   in January 1991, and so by now the United States has been using its
   military to shape events in Iraq for more than a quarter-century. And
   there is no end in sight: The next American president will almost
   surely be the fifth in succession to order airstrikes in Iraq.
