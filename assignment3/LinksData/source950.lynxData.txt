[11]Cooking with the JETS!

   Blue Chip GuacaMollie
   [12][untitled-1.jpg]
   As an uprooted Texan living in Maine for more than 25 years, I've
   learned that if I get a hankerin' for Tex-Mex, I'd better make it
   myself. So ... here's my "Mainer" variation on that healthful green
   favorite otherwise known and Guacamole.
   Ingredients:
   2-3 ripe avocados, peeled with pits removed and set aside*
   [13][untitled-2.jpg]
   1 small onion, finely chopped
   1 tsp. Worchestershire sauce or freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice
   [14][untitled-3.jpg]
   1 tsp. ground cumin
   Sea salt to taste
   Cucumber, peeled and sliced
   Fresh baby spinach leaves or mixed salad greens, washed and spun dry
   Blue corn chips
   Garnishes:
   1 ripe tomato, peeled, seeded and finely chopped or minced**
   Chopped ripe olives
   Fresh cilantro
   Sour cream
   Shredded cheddar or Monterey jack cheese
   In a small-medium mixing bowl, smash avocados with a fork to moderately
   lumpy consistency.
   [15][untitled-4.jpg]
   Add and mix in onion, Worchestershire sauce or citrus juice, cumin and
   salt.
   **Tomato may also be mixed in with avocados, onion, etc.
   Serve on a bed or sliced cukes, spinach or salad greens. Spike with
   corn ships and add your choice of garnishes.

[20]What's on My Bench???

   Some of our team members live close enough to get together in real
   life.  I’m one of those lucky team members and so is [21]Gloria of
   [22]EarthEnergyGemstones!  In true JET fashion, we decided to get
   together and play.  Gloria was interested in learning how to create
   bezels and set stones in them.  And a play date was had!!
   Fine silver bezel strip is most commonly used.  It’s pre-formed and
   comes in various widths to encircle various sized of stones.  Stones
   cut en cabochon are most commonly set, but you can also set faceted
   gems.
               • 1.       Select a stone to set.
               • 2.       Measure your bezel height.  Hold the wire next
   to the stone.  It should be about 1 mm taller than the juncture where
   the stone’s wall starts to form a curve.
               • 3.       Wrap your wire around the stone and mark where
   the wire starts to overlap.  Cut just past the mark with a pair of
   snips.
   [23][1.jpg]
               • 4.       Form the wire circle to closely fit the stone
   and make sure edges line up exactly.  No Gaps!
               • 5.       Dip your silver in a firescale prevention
   solution (2 parts denatured alcohol to 1 part boric acid crystals).
               • 6.       Set on your fire safe surface.  Set the bezel
   such that the seam sits directly on top of a piece of hard solder chip
   paillon.
   [24][2.jpg]
               • 7.       Paint flux on seam.
               • 8.       Heat with torch until solder chip melts and
   closes the seam.
               • 9.       Pickle and rinse.
               • 10.     Cut sheet silver to make a back plate for the
   bezel.
   [25][3.jpg]
               • 11.     Repeat solder steps from above to solder bezel
   onto the back plate using several medium solder chips placed inside the
   circle where the bezel touches the back plate.
   [26][4.jpg]
               • 12.     Pickle and rinse
               • 13.     Using the snips, cut excess sheet silver and sand
   until smooth and round.
   Now we have a bezel we can set a stone in.  You can do just about
   anything with a bezel.  You can make into a ring, and earring, or a
   pendant.   Today we’ve made a ring for our little moonstone cab.  We’ve
   placed our ring into a vice in order to push the bezel over the stone
   to secure it.
               • 1.       With a bezel pusher, push the bezel horizontally
   around the stone in a North, South, East, West fashion so that the
   stone is in the center.  Continue all the way around the circle.
   [27][5.jpg]
               • 2.       Now push the bezel down at the top edge, holding
   your bezel pusher at about a 50 degree angle.  It should be smooth and
   flush against your stone.
   [28][6.jpg]
               • 3.       Using a steel burnisher, smooth out the silver
   to polish the edge of the bezel.
   [29][7.jpg]
               • Ta-Da!!

[34]Cooking with the JETs

    LAMB SOUP
   Well let me just say first about how much I love my electric pressure
   cooker.  When you are busy taking care of the family and would like to
   cook fast healthy meals, an electric pressure cooker is a very big
   help!  It's like a slow cooker and you can use many of your slow cooker
   recipes, but everything cooks a lot a lot faster!
   [35][IMG_20151230_103240.jpg]
   Ingredients:
   1-1.5 pound diced lamb (I usually purchase the lamb shoulder chops
   because that's what I have available at my super market and dice them
   up)
   2 yellow onions chopped
   1 stalk celery chopped (optional)
   1 tbsp fresh or dry parsley chopped
   1 tbsp fresh cilantro chopped
   1 stick cinnamon or 1 tsp ground cinnamon
   5 strands saffron crumbled
   1/4 tsp ground ginger
   Salt & ground black pepper
   2 boxes (each approximately 32 oz) of chicken broth
   1 can (15 oz) of garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
   2 cups red lentils
   1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes or diced fresh tomatoes
   Some fresh cilantro and sour cream for garnish
   To make the soup:
   Simply get all the ingredients ready and place everything in the
   pressure cooker pot and mix.
   [36][IMG_20151230_103306.jpg]
   Close and seal the pressure cooker and put for 18 min.  Yes, for only
   18 min! When the marker is at "0", for this particular recipe I usually
   release the pressure by turning the seal switch.  When all the pressure
   is out, I safely open the top and my soup is ready with meat very soft
   and all the ingredients cooked.  I check the salt and adjust it if need
   to and that's it!
   [37][IMG_20151230_104026.jpg]
   Serve it garnished with some sour cream, cilantro and enjoy!

[42]What's on My Bench???

   Finding the Flash in Labradorite
   Labradorite is one of my very favorite gemstones to work with. Its
   mysterious colors that appear from such an unassuming neutral
   background are so beautiful, and surprising. It got its name from the
   Labrador Peninsula in Canada where it was found by Moravian
   missionaries in 1770 in the early 19^th Century. The local Inuit people
   knew about it for much longer and believed that Labradorite fell from
   the frozen fire of the Northern Lights. They believed  this ordinary
   looking stone could transform into the extraordinary, since it holds
   the energy and the colors of the Aurora Borealis.
   Labradorite is a mineral of the plagioclase feldspar group with a
   hardness of 6-6.5. The amazing play of color in the stone is known as
   “labradorescence”. The background color of Labradorite is usually gray
   to gray-green, brownish-gray, dark blue-gray or black. Since it is made
   up of aggregate layers that refract light, iridescent flashes in the
   blue, green, gold or red range can be seen varying with the angle of
   light. There are rarer varieties of Labradorite that include Golden
   Labradorite which is a transparent gold or champagne color, and
   Spectrolite which can display the whole color spectrum and especially a
   vivid electric blue. This variety was discovered in Finland in the
   1940s.
   What’s on my bench today are some labradorite cabochons which need to
   be set. The challenge in working with labradorite is to find which
   direction you see the flash of color and set the stone so the color can
   best be seen. I find that  by “playing with them” and moving the stones
   around I can see how the light affects them. That will help me
   determine how to use these cabochons - in hanging settings, or in
   horizontal settings.
   [43][IMG_9803.JPG]
   In the first photo the 10mm x 8mm stone appears dark, with no
   labradorescence.
   [44][IMG_9806.JPG]
   In the 2^nd photo I’ve reversed the direction from top to bottom, and
   there’s the flash~ Now it will make a lovely pendant and the color can
   be enjoyed.
   [45][IMG_9808.JPG]
   Looking at this group of small 7x5mm cabochons and another 10x8mm cab,
   some show flash but most do not. So I will move them around to see
   which direction they best show labradorescence. The pair at the lower
   right corner shows a match of color and flash on the front.
   [46][IMG_9809.JPG]

   In the second photo the same group is rearranged and shows the
   direction the flash is best viewed. I’ve reversed the direction of the
   corner pair so you can see they would not show flash if set in this
   direction.
   [47][IMG_9812.JPG]
   Sometimes you want the pretty colors to be viewed from the side of the
   stones, so these photos show how the cabochons look from these
   directions.

   [48][IMG_9813.JPG]
   Some of the stones look more vibrant, viewing them from the side.
   [49][IMG_9824.JPG]
   These are some larger, faceted and set Labradorite cabochons I bought.
   There’s not a lot going on when viewing them sideways. But the green
   and gold one shows some labradorescence.
   [50][IMG_9825.JPG]
   Here’s the slightly domed side of the cabochons, viewed lengthwise top
   to bottom:
   [51][IMG_9826.JPG]
   And now here’s the other side.
   The green and gold labradorite has possibilities to be used
   horizontally in a bracelet or vertically as a pendant, and both sides
   are amazing. I would use the blue labradorite in a pendant since it
   looks best seen vertically.
   And last, here are some earrings I’ve been working on.  By looking
   through the small cabochons from the group above and using the method
   of viewing them placed in different directions I was able to match a
   pair of labradorite 7mm x 5mm cabochons. They both show blue
   labradorescence, and because the flash is at the top and front of the
   stones I’ve set them vertically.

[56]One of My Favorites

   Hi my name is [57]Lora of [58]DivineSpiritCreations and designer of
   Pyrex Jewelry in addition to other silver and gemstone jewelry. But I
   wanted to talk to you today about one of my favorite tools - my vintage
   muffin tins.
   That's right muffin tins. I use them in my design process to hold
   materials as I create - the mini tins are the perfect depth to hold
   stones and findings and they're all right in front of you.
   [59][2016-02-04%2B11.15.37.jpg]
    I used the larger and decorative vintage tins to hold items that are
   "in process" since at a certain point I like to assembly line certain
   things.
   [60][2016-02-04%2B11.16.30.jpg]
    I've even used my muffin tins for travel to shows and for storage.
   [61][2016-02-04%2B11.14.42.jpg]
   So easily found at yard sales and thrift shops at a cost-effective
   price, and when I can find cute vintage ones it just adds to the
   atmosphere in my studio ♡
   I hope maybe this is giving you a different outlook on some unusual
   items either in your home or when you're out looking at yard sales for
   items that you might be able to use in your studios. Cheers!
