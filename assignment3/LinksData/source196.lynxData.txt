   Università dell'Immagine, (also known as "UI") was the post-secondary
   training school of Fondazione Industria Onlus Milan, a non-profit
   organization founded by the photographer Fabrizio Ferri. UI offered an
   experimental, two-year certificate program on the [7]five senses in
   [8]Milan, [9]Italy, between 1998 and 2005.^[10][1]

Ferri's Philosophy of the Image[[17]edit]

   Università dell'Immagine literally translates in English as "the
   University of the Image." Fabrizio Ferri, UI's founder, and an early
   pioneer in the usage of digital technology in [18]fashion photography,
   wanted to create a campus environment where creative professionals from
   disparate fields would find common ground in studying the word
   "immagine" or image. Ferri believes that images are not merely visual
   stimuli, nor are they static objects. According to Ferri, “Image is the
   harmony defined by the integrated work of the senses.”

   While developing the two-year training program of UI with Tania Silvia
   Gianesin, the school's eventual Dean, Ferri compiled his ideas in
   various written documents, including UI's brochure, enrollment
   documents and academic lectures. According to Ferri, "Image is the form
   of [19]communication, [20]language and [21]literature of this new
   century. An image originates from a received [22]input, which is
   elaborated in order to express a personal "point of view" that can be
   communicated through different means. All [23]creative processes are
   defined by the sequence: input, elaboration and output. These three
   terms also describe the synthesis of the digital system. The individual
   [24]perception of values - just as one’s own point of view - must be
   formed by a process of [25]knowledge, elaboration and synthesis, in
   order to be valuable and useful. Should this process not occur, the
   resulting image would be hurled in the void of 'professionalism'
   without culture. It is not 'the end that justifies the [26]means' that
   frees us from responsibilities, but the understanding of the ends for a
   responsible choice of the means."

Mission[[27]edit]

   Università dell'Immagine was the formative school of Fondazione
   Industria Onlus Milan, founded by Fabrizio Ferri. It was a two-year
   course that prepared young people for the diverse trades related to
   [28]image and [29]communication, understood as professions
   [30]holistically viewed through all senses. The formative activity was
   therefore realized through a program constructed around the [31]five
   senses – [32]sight, [33]hearing, [34]touch, [35]taste, and [36]smell –
   and the links between them, the [37]synergy and [38]coherence of the
   contents. The subject matter was organized following the guidelines:
   Input, Elaboration, Output, to which Research is added, applied in turn
   through UI's various laboratories, including the Laboratory of the
   Senses and the Laboratory of Psychophysiology.

   The work of the [39]students and [40]teachers involved exercises,
   projects and lessons, and tended towards: a return to a [41]sensitivity
   such that one can use the senses consistent with their expression; to
   contribute to knowledge and recognition of the inclinations of the
   students, safeguarding their originality and [42]authenticity; to
   accompany and orient the choices of individual students; to create a
   good working team; to encourage interaction of diverse approaches and
   elaboration, rather than transmit a predefined knowledge; to define the
   relationship between [43]ethics and [44]aesthetics.

   The school was set up on the principle of auto-determination and
   self-evaluation and therefore measured only the sense of
   responsibility, sociability, seriousness and authenticity of the
   students, who were selected for businesses through the realization of
   projects and an [45]internship program, consistent with their
   aptitudes. The school had an international vocation and welcomed
   students of various nationalities, facilitating and promoting a
   multicultural approach.

Administration and Organisation[[46]edit]

   The two-year course had 158 [47]international students in total, coming
   from 12 different countries. Dean of the Università dell'Immagine,
   since its foundation up to the final year, was Tania Silvia
   Gianesin.^[48][2]

Campus[[56]edit]

   The campus was based in a conversion [57]warehouse building located in
   Via Gaspare Bugatti 7, Milan, Italy. The premises were next to
   Industria Superstudio (shooting studios), Industria Musica (recording
   studios) and Ristorante Industria (restaurant), were UI lessons and
   projects often took place. Students had also access to a [58]dance
   hall, where [59]Aikido, [60]Yoga/Body Awareness classes and special
   projects were held.

Projects[[61]edit]

   Throughout the years the school developed creative and research
   projects for/with international clients and institutions.^[62][4]
