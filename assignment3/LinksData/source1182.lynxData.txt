   Digital Transformation

Five steps to make your ideas real

   Digital Transformation and Visionary Innovation know no bounds.
   With Qwince as your technology partner, your seed of an idea can grow,
   evolve and become reality.
     * I Invent: we pinpoint opportunities
     * D Design: we engineer visionary innovation
     * E Execute: we build digital transformation
     * A Accelerate: we integrate wearables
     * S Secure: we secure internet of things

INVENT: We are your digital innovation and digital transformation partner

   We’ll help you identify and utilise opportunities and challenges. To do
   this, we conduct different research and digital transformation projects
   to find new products for our customer.
   For example, we worked with [32]Brunel University in London on
   [33]Thalmic Labs’ MYO gesture control armband, to help elderly,
   disabled and low-mobility users to wirelessly control their favourite
   technologies. Thalmic Myo

   MYO is an emerging technology that lets us implement a new form of user
   interface that uses EMG signals from the forearm.
   Gestures are recognised before movement thanks to muscle activity and
   9-axis inertial measurement unit (MEMS) MYO embeds a Bluetooth 4.0 Low
   Energy chip for connectivity.
   We are considering applications in the military, consumer and
   professional field.

   [34]Found out more in the ‘Our Work’ section.

DESIGN: We engineer visionary innovation

   Have a bright idea but don’t know what to do with it?
   We are a group of highly skilled and experienced data scientist and
   engineers with plenty of technical expertise and passion…

   Digital Transformation in healthcare (m-Health and e-Health) is
   reality. We are designing and developing a customisable digital
   framework for patient engagement and medication adherence solutions,
   which: Empatica E4
     * combines education, reward, monitoring and screening to motivate
       the patients,
     * uses digital health devices (such as [35]Empatica E4,
       [36]Cardiocity…) to collect reliable big data and improve the
       outcomes of therapy effectiveness,
     * sustain healthy behaviours thanks to gamifications and rewards,
     * involves different healthcare delivery organisations (HDO) and
       participants in the process,
     * provides advanced analytics to care providers based on big data.

   [37]Find out more in the ‘Our Work’ section.

EXECUTE: We build digital transformation

   With our background as a security integrator, our main priority is the
   security of your data and communications.  For example, we are
   designing and developing a secure identification system based on
   [38]NYMI technology. NYMI

   NYMI has enormous potential to improve our lives, it works by using
   your unique electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to act as a biometric
   authentication layer for other devices, applications and services. So
   NYMI uses your heartbeat like a password to confirm your identity.

   This system offers three authentication levels: the wristband itself,
   user’s unique cardiac rhythm and its mobile device, like a smartphone
   or tablet.

   Our mission is to enable the Digital Transformation.

ACCELERATE: We evolve wearable technology

   We build digital transformation culture, boost innovation capability
   and confidence in technology and data security.
   Wearable technology can introduce great changes in our
   future. Neuralya (our brand new product) is our acceleration and
   evolution project. Emotiv EPOC+

   Based on a human behavior and biometric data collection platform
   by [39]iMotion, Neuralya looks at a set of physiological parameters
   (facial coding, eye tracking, skin conductance, EEG…), using wearable
   devices (such as [40]Empatica E4, Gazepoint Eye Tracking, [41]Emotiv
   Epoc +...), to evaluate the rational, emotional and instinctual
   components behind your customers’ choices.

SECURE: We secure your Internet of Things

   Our platform and our skills help organisations to protect and manage
   their logical, physical and cloud-based data assets.

   An example is HYLA EYES on VUZIX M100 smartglasses. VUZIX M100
   We are qualified as an early adopter by the VUZIX DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.
   We prototyped our product Hyla Eyes on Vuzix M100.
   Hyla Eyes is a secure data collection and certification system based on
   mobile devices, allowing completely secure communication with a control
   room and rendering data collected in the field uneditable.

   Digital tools are provoking significant changes in the way we work,
   communicate, and sell. This implies new opportunities and challenges,
   and has triggered the Digital Transformation of enterprises.

     experienced professionals and innovation skills. Securproject.it is

     effective, quick, skilled, innovation oriented, made up by creative
     and reliable resources, able to satisfy the customers needs and
     identify the market opportunities."

   Stefano Di Lecce, CEO, [63]Innovandia

     "A young company of experienced professionals in ICT sector. I
     worked with them very well and together we managed serious issues.
     Well done, guys!"

   Senior Researcher, [64]Engineering

     "Our feedback is surely positive. We perceived competence, precision
     and reliability while working with you."

   Executive, [65]Caffè Trombetta

     "When I first reviewed PopPling as a social media tool, I wasn’t
     fully convinced that it would be appreciated by the mature audience
     we were expecting for our fund-raising international charity event.
     However, on the day, it was a hit. The audience, mostly old and a
     few young, loved seeing the instant pictures on screen, and the
     charity won more than a few points for tapping into this new and
     exciting tool. Moving forward, I can see a great potential for
     PopPling in a variety of settings and commercial environments. In
     addition, the Qwince team behind PopPling are insightful, very
     enthusiastic and eager to work with clients to ensure that events
     are enhanced through their tools. I will definitely be recommending
     PopPling to my other clients, and will look for ways to incorporate
     them into events and crowd situations."
