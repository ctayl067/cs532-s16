[3]The West Coast is On Fire and I'm scared

   The West Coast is Burning
   Oh, not the coast part of the West Coast. At least, not yet. But The
   West Coast, ie everything from Alaska through BC and on down the west
   coast states and provinces of North America, through Washington,
   Oregon, California, all the way to Baja Mexico. The West Coast is on
   fire.
   As far as I can tell no one east of the West Coast even cares.
   Wildfires happen, but not like this. People in Baker City, Oregon are
   taking refuge at the elementary school. The wettest place in North
   America that isn't under a lake, the Olympic Rainforest in Washington,
   is burning. It's one of the few temperate rainforests in the world, and
   it's on fire.
   I can smell the woodsmoke in my bedroom in Oregon. The fires the smoke
   is coming from are hundreds of miles away.
   That's how bad it is.
   The West Coast is on fire, and I'm fucking terrified. Does the rest of
   the US even care?

[13]Red Cross

   Free write 5/18/2014
   When all was said and done there wasn't much to say. I stared at my
   partner's widow, and she stared back at me, pale and blood-splattered,
   her normally dark skin ashen gray. “I hate you,” she said, and she said
   it so simply as if it was nothing more than a statement of fact. My
   lips and fingertips tingled and I could feel myself growing cold as the
   blood flowed out through the IV and onto the floor. I was going to
   bleed to death, right here in this death chamber than until a half an
   hour ago was a Red Cross blood-mobile. She stared at me, her face
   perfectly expressionless even as she raised end of the IV to her mouth
   and sucked, like a child sucking cherry juice through a straw. It
   wasn't her fault, I knew. It was mine.
   And her husband's. My partner's.
   We really didn't mean of any of this to happen, but intentions and the
   road to hell and all that.
   I licked my lips, feeling incredibly thirsty, but there wasn't a chance
   in hell I was getting cookies and juice now. “What did you do with his
   body?” I asked. He was dead, I knew that for a fact, no one but no one
   survives having their head hacked off and placed on a pike. But I had
   no idea where the hell the rest of him was. I suppose, given the
   current circumstances, it shouldn't really matter to me, but it did. It
   really did. “Did you have him cremated?”
   She pinched the IV shut, folding it in half and squeezing tight. The
   flow of my blood stopped momentarily along with my death. A temporary
   reprieve.
   “I know you and Rich thought I was stupid,” she said to me, her calm
   hatred lashing me with a hundred million whips. “But I'm not. His blood
   was contaminated, and he contaminated me. Of course I had him cremated,
   I wasn't going to let him be chopped to pieces in your lab.”
   My lab. Our lab. She put the IV back to her lips, unfolding it and
   letting the blood flow once more. I knew was she was doing of course,
   and despite what she may have felt me and Rich never thought she was
   stupid.
   You infected me, you pieces of shit, she'd spat at us when we realized
   what had happened to Rich, and Mary. And it had been true. But in our
   defense we hadn't meant to, we hadn't meant for the virus to go wild,
   or for it to have the effects that it did. But again, intentions and
   the hell and roads and so forth. Rich had been quivering in the final
   stages of the disease as he pleaded with his wife, he hadn't meant any
   of this.
   I strained briefly against the straps. The Red Cross doesn't strap
   anyone down, but that hadn't stopped the phlebotomists any this time
   around. They'd looked at me with dead eyes the moment I stepped out of
   the little questionnaire room and grabbed me, unnaturally strong for a
   bunch of middle aged health care professionals. Then Mary stepped out
   and stared at me, and I knew there was no going back.
   “Rich had the virus,” she said calmly. Unlike the movies her teeth
   looked normal. Her canines had not lengthened, her incisors had not
   sharpened. The virus did not attack the teeth one bit, even as it drove
   the metabolism insane. “He gave it to me. But you don't, and I wondered
   why. Why did I get it, and you didn't? You fucked him as much as I did.
   You should have gotten it.”
   Again, truth. She wasn't stupid.
   She took the IV out of her mouth again. The blood in her mouth turned
   her teeth slick and red. It flooded out of the tube for a moment, then
   she pinched it off again. I felt cold and short of breath, and I
   wondered how much I had bleed already. The other donors had already
   left, the phlebotomists with their dead eyes had taken their donations
   as if everything was perfectly normal and not a single one of the other
   donors had been hurt or killed. I was relieved in a way, Mary's anger
   had been directed solely at me. The virus had not driven her insane
   with bloodlust, like we thought it would. Perhaps everything would be
   okay in this new world Rich and I had created.
   Even if we didn't get to see it.
   “So I wondered, was the vampire virus the only one you created? And the
   answer was of course not. You were playing God,” and here she snarled.
   “God! And I know you scientists, you worked with a variety of strains,
   not merely one. You're infected too. Just, you know, with something
   else.” She laugh humorlessly. “And you're such a cowardly shit that
   you'd rather I bleed you to death than save yourself.”
   Muscles knotted under my skin. It was true. It was equally true that I
   was letting her kill me. Mary had proved that the v-virus was safe in
   the modern world, relatively speaking. She would only kill those who
   had wronged her, and only at the level of betrayal that I and Rich had
   cast upon her.
   Too late, my bones turned to dust and cracked, cracked, cracked beneath
   my skin, my muscles rippled. I licked my lips again.
   “You better kill me quick,” I said, my voice dim and distant in my own
   ears. My muscles were tearing inside me, my skin was turning purple
   with the bruising. I didn't know I had that much blood still left in
   me.
   She laughed and pressed a bit of gauze against the needle in my arm,
   pulling my arm up above my head. She pulled the needle out with a jerk
   and pressed the gauze tight, and smiled at me. Chilling.
   “No,” Mary said. “I want you to become your own monster. You've done
   this to me, and you killed Rich, so I get to watch.”
   My muscles clenched again in one spastic cramp, rending and tearing
   myself from the inside out. The w-virus was tearing me apart, one cell
   at a time.
   And Mary got to watch.

   I really really like this story and I'm disappointed that the author
