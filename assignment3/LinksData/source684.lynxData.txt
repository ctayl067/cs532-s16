MRC Clinician Scientist and Senior Lecturer

   Mr Tim Underwood is MRC Clinician Scientist and Senior Lecturer within
   Medicine at the University of Southampton.

   Tim Underwood was appointed as an MRC Clinician Scientist in 2011. He
   graduated from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine (London) in
   1998 with a first class BSc in Molecular Medicine and the Gant Medal
   for Surgery. He trained in General Surgery in London and Southampton
   before completing a PhD in the Blaydes laboratory in 2007. He has
   subsequently specialized in Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery with a
   special interest in oesophageal cancer and minimally invasive surgical
   techniques. He was awarded the Association of Surgeons of GB & I prize
   and medal for his outstanding performance in the final FRCS exams in
   February 2011.
   Mr Underwood was appointed as an NIHR Clinical Lecturer in Surgery in
   2008 and developed a research program to investigate stromal-epithelial
   interactions in the oesophagus. He has developed a 3D organotypic model
   of the human oesophagus and is currently using this to study the role
   of cancer associated fibroblasts in the development and maintenance of
   oesophageal cancer.
   Mr Underwood is collaborating with Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald (MRC Cancer
   Cell Unit, Cambridge) on a CRUK funded project to sequence to
   oesophageal cancer genome as part of the International Cancer Genome
   Consortium ([136]www.icgc.org).

Research interests

   Mr Underwood’s research has a focus on the development and progression
   of upper GI cancer, in particular oesophageal cancer. His surgical
   science interests include minimally invasive surgery and pre and
   post-operative predictors of outcome after oesophagogastic surgery.

Stromal-epithelial interactions in oesophageal cancer

   Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the fastest rising cancer in the
   UK; the incidence has doubled in men over the last 25 years. At
   presentation the majority of oesophageal tumours will have invaded
   through the wall of the oesophagus, meaning that only 20% of patients
   will be suitable for curative treatment. Early invasion leads to
   disseminated disease and an overall five year survival of only 7%, one
   of the lowest of any cancer.
   Southampton offers a unique opportunity to perform research in
   oesophageal cancer. The surgical unit performs over 80 upper
   gastro-intestinal cancer resections per year and the biomedical
   research facility is a 2 minute walk from the operating theatre. This
   allows Mr Underwood’s team to exploit their access to primary tissue
   for laboratory research; furthermore:

   • Mr Underwood has set up a comprehensive, ethically approved
   oesophageal tissue bank that contains over 200 patients’ samples
   including cell isolates, frozen tissue and matched blood from
   diagnostic endoscopy and oesophageal resections. The tissue bank is
   linked to a rigorously maintained prospective database that allows
   biological findings to be correlated with clinico-pathological patient
   outcomes.

   • The team is able to culture oesophageal epithelial cells and
   fibroblasts directly from resected specimens.
   Molecular studies of carcinogenesis have traditionally been conducted
   on cells that form the tumour i.e. – epithelial cells and less focus
   has been placed on the epithelial microenvironment (stroma). An
   emerging body of evidence suggests that the stroma is important in the
   initiation and progression of a range of epithelial cancers including
   skin, breast, prostate and ovary, but little is known about the role of
   the stroma in oesophageal carcinogenesis. The stroma contains a number
   of cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and immune
   cells, all of which may have a role in tumour progression. Mr
   Underwood’s research concentrates on cancer associated fibroblasts
   (CAF) as recent evidence suggests that CAF are fundamental to tumour
   biology. CAF differ in phenotype from normal fibroblasts, and
   functional studies indicate that fibroblasts play a role in cancer
   initiation, progression and metastasis. Information regarding the role
   of the tumour microenvironment in oesophageal cancer is limited. It is
   clear that the gene expression profile of stromal cells is altered in
   EAC and its precursor lesion Barrett’s oesophagus (BE). However, the
   events required for fibroblast activation, the timing of fibroblast
   activation in the BE-EAC sequence and the influence that CAF have on
   EAC progression are yet to be elucidated.

   Using a 3D organotypic model developed in the Underwood laboratory the
   team have shown that primary oesophageal CAF promote invasion compared
   to normal oesophageal fibroblasts. Moreover, CAF promote the invasion
   of normal oesophageal squamous cells suggesting that invasion in this
   model is stromal cell dependent. The team has therefore begun an
   analysis of candidate molecules which may be responsible for this
   effect. They have identified several CAF associated candidates,
   including the TGF-β related gene periostin, on which they have begun a
   functional analysis.
