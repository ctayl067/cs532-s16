   The random ramblings of a lazy yet ambitious optimist...

[3]Guest post

   Okay so here is an insightful post by a friend which I thought I'd
   share with you people. Please post your comments, if any, here. I'll
   make sure the original author, who wishes to be anonymous, sees it!
   When we were in college we all must have dreamed of what we would do
   with our first salary. Back then we thought that our first salary would
   be the source of eternal joy. Although we might have said otherwise,
   our first criterion for choosing companies during placement was
   invariably the “package” offered. Work began, we eagerly waited for the
   25th of that month. We tweeted and posted on Facebook about the salary
   getting credited and felt really proud. But by the 28th of that month,
   we were done treating friends, buying stuff that we planned for, spent
   it all and within no time lost all the excitement. Unlike what we had
   assumed, the happiness gained from it didn't seem like a long term
   thing.
   This little incident kept nudging me to find out why that so-called
   “eternal joy” faded away so soon. What does it take to stay happy?
   It is believed that those who have satisfaction in life
   are comparatively more peaceful and successful. But satisfaction
   here doesn't mean being complacent with where you are. It is
   human nature to always crave for something better. It could be higher
   studies, a promotion or doing really good work and being appreciated
   for the same. Ambition is what drives us forward. If we weren't longing
   for more, wanting to change, we would have stayed where we were.
   Sometimes even laziness can be a boon when it comes to changing for the
   better. Some of the most useful inventions probably happened because
   some lazy guy came up with an idea to make his life easier. I kid you
   not!
   Coming back to ambition, I believe that ambition should be absolute and
   not relative. Comparisons with others can spoil the benefits of
   ambition. Some people might be good at singing or sports or public
   speaking. That is because they were dedicated, systematic, organised
   and enjoyed it. Accept that fact, try to find out how they got better
   at it, get inspired and try hard to improve rather than just being
   envious and sad that we can't be like those talented people. Set your
   own targets, appraise yourself regularly and ask yourself
   if you've done justice to yourself and not whether you have done better
   than others. Trying to be better than someone can be a motivation, but
   once you do beat that certain someone, what do you do next? Isn't it
   better to set your own targets than rely on others?
   Appreciate yourself and the gifts you have been blessed with, challenge
   yourself to make the most of those gifts and most importantly, take
   pleasure out of the little things in life that happen more frequently
   and you'll find that you’re considerably ahead of your peers in that
   most difficult of pursuits, the pursuit of happiness. Appreciate
   yourself and the gifts you have been blessed with, challenge yourself
   to make the most of those gifts and most importantly, take pleasure out
   of the little things in life that happen more frequently and you'll
   find that you’re considerably ahead of your peers in that most
   difficult of pursuits, the pursuit of happiness.
   Just as we shouldn't compare ourselves with others, it’s important not
   to worry about what others think about us. Happy people are
   spontaneous, natural and real, they say what they think and feel,
   and aren't concerned what others think of them. But at times when we
   feel really demotivated, we should try to find our own individual
   strength. No matter how weak we believe we are, we have an inner
   strength that has brought us through several hard times in life. We
   must reflect on those times and see how far we have come by the power
   of our own will and determination. Appreciate what you've been able to
   do, whether it was managing to get a good job, or fixing a bug or even
   writing a blog post.
   Happy people do what they enjoy and enjoy what they do. To be happy,
   you need to be comfortable with what you do. There’s no point being
   stuck in a job you hate, surrounded by unfriendly colleagues just
   because the money is good. Many spend the best years of their lives
   trying to make money, sacrificing their health and family in the
   process. Later, they spend the same money they made working trying to
   recover their lost health and alienated family. Very few of us really
   stop to enjoy the small things in life. We're so focused on attending
   meetings, answering our calls, and checking our email that many of us
   forget that there really is a beautiful world beyond our work space.
   Every day at work, take some time out, make friends, hang out, sit
   together and work as a team and celebrate even for small
   accomplishments.
   Something great and wonderful happening shouldn't be the only cause for
   happiness. If you believe that winning a prize or buying yourself that
   cell phone or car that you've been wanting so long is going to make you
   happy, you're absolutely right. It will make you happy for about two
   hours. Then you'll be looking for something else to bring on that shot
   of joy.
   Appreciate yourself and the gifts you have been blessed with, challenge
   yourself to make the most of those gifts and most importantly, take
   pleasure out of the little things in life that happen more frequently
   and you'll find that you’re considerably ahead of your peers in that
   most difficult of pursuits, the pursuit of happiness.

[10]Season 7

   I haven’t blogged for a while after my... er, passionate Independence
   Day post. Now that the semester is over, I think it’s time that I tell
   you people a bit about it. And anyone with an idea of how things work
   at most engineering colleges will know that the last two semesters are
   mostly, if not all about placements and admits. In my case, it was
   sadly all about placements. The ‘sadly’ has been introduced as a result
   of my summer internship making me realize what work after BTech means
   for a mechanical engineer.
   Anyway, this post is mostly about my placement experience. You’ve been
   warned in advance, so don’t read this if you’re not interested in such
   boring stuff. My preparations for placement season were quite thorough,
   as thorough as most preparations for any exam from third year and
   ahead. I guess I need not say more. The first company to visit for
   mechanical was Bajaj. Actually it was among the first companies to
   visit campuses altogether. Having worked at a motorcycle company over
   the summer, my dislike for automobile companies had only increased.
   Yet, being the focused and determined person I am, I sat for Bajaj.
   Bajaj is sort of like the Microsoft for mechies I guess. It pays well
   (best in the market, significantly more than certain companies which
   think of themselves as Bajaj’s competitors), location is good (Pune),
   profiles are challenging and the company as a whole is virtually the
   best indigenous manufacturer of bikes here. So, we all sat for it out
   of respect actually (the ones who weren’t that keen on it even). I was
   so confident and keen on the company that I hadn’t even bothered to
   bring my formal clothes or shoes. I just sat for the test because it
   would be a good experience. As it turned out, the paper had both
   general aptitude and technical questions with, wait for it, equal
   weightage. I focused on the general aptitude questions and attempted a
   few technical ones. I got lucky and qualified for the interview. Yes,
   Bajaj were all about quick and efficient recruitment methods. There was
   just one interview and they said they didn’t bother about what we wore.
   All the same, I didn’t want to be the only one in casual clothes and
   ran back to the hostel to borrow pants from one guy, shirt and tie from
   another and... Well it was chaotic, to say the least. I took my
   documents and ran to the Training & Placement department. I don’t
   remember having to wait that long. My interview was quick and
   enlightening. It was clear that not only was I disinterested in
   automobiles but I was also quite incompetent at them. Or that’s what
   the interviewers made me feel like. I was asked a few questions on my
   project on lighting systems in automobiles (which was pretty useless, I
   must admit) and then later I was asked a question on how I’d make
   vehicles more efficient without touching the engine (yes, that was it,
   it was that general) I told them about making the vehicle more
   streamlined with the aid of some very clumsy figures, talked about how
   a vehicle that hugs the road with down force ultimately gets more
   traction (is that right?) and about how CVT can give more appropriate
   gear ratios for every speed and thus increase efficiency. I guess that
   wasn’t enough.
   Having not had much hope anyway, I returned to my room to later find
   out that 5 people had been recruited. Company 1 down.
   The next one was Caterpillar. Now for those who don’t know about this
   company, it is the world’s biggest manufacturer of construction and
   mining equipment and machinery. They’re a Fortune 50 company if I’m not
   wrong and are very proud of what they do, rightly so. They are by no
   means a ‘low profile’ company and don’t want people who see them a
   stepping stone to higher studies or some 2 year stint. At NITK they are
   up there with Bajaj in terms of pay and frankly even work I guess.
   Okay, so the test. This time I had brought my formals, thankfully. I
   wrote the test, which had aptitude, technical and verbal components.
   Technical was the most important part this time. The topics which I
   remember were thermodynamics, hydraulics and pneumatics (major portion,
   this), fluid mechanics and manufacturing. The test was pretty tough and
   far more of a challenge than the Bajaj test. I say this because I
   qualified in this as well. I know, how modest right? I somehow made it
   through. There was a group discussion which went quite smoothly. I
   think the topic was about how education is/isn’t necessary for success.
   I thought it was and spoke a bit. The interview was easy. They asked me
   about my CGPA trend and why it had a negative slope. To be honest, they
   didn’t seem very bothered by it. They asked me about my project. Asked
   me about the effect an open fridge had on itself and its surroundings.
   They also asked me to define a tool and a machine, which was slightly
   weird and also fun. Bottles, pens and the AC were used as examples. And
   then they asked me my interests to which I said strength of
   materials/structural. They asked me to design a diving board from
   scratch and it was pretty easy given that to me it was basically about
   designing a very flexible cantilever. The problem was, I was having
   second thoughts about the work and the location. They had no guarantee
   as to whether they would assign me an R&D job or a manufacturing one. I
   know this was a bit arrogant on my part, but I voiced these concerns
   and also asked them about the possibility of relocation. They weren’t
   pleased by this I guess or maybe didn’t find me good enough. All the
   same, Company No. 2 was down. Truth be told, I wasn’t that sad about
   this either.
   In the following days quite a few companies came and went. I would go
   to their presentations and get disappointed with some aspect of the
   job. These were the initial days and some of the companies I skipped
   were actually gems which I stupidly did not try for out of greed.
   There, I said it. Others, the work was simply not what I expected and
   I’m happy to have not tried for. Oh, and I tried for Pepsico but was
   deemed unfit in the preliminary online psychometric test. That was
   interesting. Psychometric tests are awesome, you should try one.
   Next came the one company I really wanted. Tata Motors, a Tata company,
   market leader in many segments, a job profile that gave an insane
   amount of exposure to the industry, good locations and a good
   compensation package. The test was conducted a few days before they
   came to the campus and it was online. Most of the questions were
   general aptitude and verbal. The technical part was varied in terms of
   topics. I remember questions on gears and other drives, production and
   operations management etc. The on campus process involved a group
   discussion followed by two interviews. The GD was on whether Indian
   television was exploiting the youth. The next technical interview was
   the longest I have faced. It went on for more than 50 minutes. I was
   asked questions on my project, manufacturing processes (I was asked
   what a pattern was, specifically),  Iron-Carbon diagrams and was
   grilled for around half an hour on why Finite Element Methods are
   required. Also a question on how section modulus impacts the member’s
   load carrying capacity where I was asked to quantitatively prove this
   for an ‘I’ section. That was it. The next interview was an HR
   interview. The HR guy seemed to be making an overt attempt at an accent
   and to be honest, trying to emphasize his ‘HR’ness. I guess it is
   pretty clear that I did not like him in the least, with his. His
   language was difficult to comprehend and at one point he said ‘crub’
   instead of ‘curb’, which I unconsciously corrected. He seemed to have a
   severe disagreement with some points I had expressed during my GD and
   he brought them up. When I defended them, I was labelled as arrogant.
   Well, if that was the case I have no regrets in not making it there. If
   I was expected to not defend what i thought was right just to get the
   job, I’d rather be unemployed. Either he used that point to test me (in
   which case I took the bait most gloriously) or he did something very
   wrong by trying to impose his personal opinion on me and disregarding
   me because I did not yield. That or I was simply not good enough for
   the tech guy, which I have no problem with. Anyway, Company 3 down. I
   was pretty disappointed this time.
   The next few days involved more disappointing presentations and
   returning to the room.
   Irunway. This company was one which I’d never heard of before. They
   were basically a firm which helped companies sue others by ascertaining
   if and how patent infringements were made. Good pay, interesting job
   and a great location made me register for it. The test was interesting.
   There were some reasoning & comprehension questions with the subject
   matter being mainly consumer electronics and associated technologies,
   some mathematical questions (Olympiad type and basic calculus), a few
   programming questions (C++, mainly logic based) and some mechanical
   ones. It also has a small essay type question where you were supposed
   to write about your aims and interests. Anyway, that evening we had the
   Tata Steel test which I was more interested in. Tata Steel pays very
   well and although the location is not that great at first sight, it is
   supposed to be a very fulfilling and secure job. The test that evening
   was another case. Insanely difficult, it was made for a metallurgy
   student rather than a mechie. Questions were asked on steel, how it is
   made, its properties, basic manufacturing processes, fluid mechanics
   and thermo. Towards the end I was just ticking answers randomly in
   spite of the negative marking system. I was more hurriedly doing this
   because at the beginning of the test I was informed that I had
   qualified for the Irunway interviews happening RIGHT THEN. It had
   started raining, so I wrote what I could and ran to my room, dressed
   and went to TnP. The interview was bizarre. Like a sort of HR round,
   the guy asked me about my interest, football, regarding interesting
   incidents that happened on campus (I told him about the rickshaw
   accident I had two days ago) and other such stuff. We had discussions
   on relativity and how Newton was different in terms of expressing the
   law of gravity. Yup, it was a very strange interview. I qualified for
   the next round where I was asked questions on IC engines, Wankel
   engines and questions on guesstimation (estimating the number of
   Joshuas in the world, the number of webpages created everyday). I was
   asked to explain some of my answers in the written test too, and failed
   miserably at solving the C++ questions. I won’t elaborate, they were
   really laughable. The impression I got from this interview and the
   subsequent lone recruitment was that they wanted someone who knew his
   stuff well (whether that was Rock Blasting or Artificial Intelligence
   was immaterial to them) and also someone with a fairly high IQ.
   Expected, given the nature of their work. They wanted a smart person
   who was thorough. Okay, Company 4 down (or if you include Pepsi,
   Company 5).
   By now I was panicking. There wasn’t any news about any good companies
   coming in the foreseeable future (read Placement Site schedule). By
   good, I mean the companies whose profiles seemed appealing to me. There
   was Reliance, and that was it. My hopes about Atkins or L&T (Bombay)
   coming were dashed. Reliance had a good reputation. Okay, that goes
   without saying. The location was not bad, I absolutely adored the CM of
   Gujarat and some really good seniors were there. The presentation
   reinforced that. The profile they offered was not exactly in line with
   my interest but it was good, with great potential for professional
   growth.
   Okay, I’ll cut the crap. I wanted to get placed and get it over with,
   and Reliance was more than enough. The presentation was embarrassing
   because of the power cut and the projector flopping as usual. The test
   involved aptitude and verbal questions which were very easy but
   required effective time management. Technical was okay, focusing on
   manufacturing processes, fluid machinery (pumps, pumps and more pumps)
   and some other subjects which I totally forgot. I qualified for the
   interviews. Me and the department’s erstwhile topper were sitting
   together and revising (now that I think of it, this was the first
   interview before which I actually did some focused study. Thank you
   Tintin for that little bit of motivation) We were lucky, both of us
   were asked questions on topics which we had seen moments ago on
   Wikipedia. That reminds me, thank you Jimmy Wales and team. I shall
   definitely donate soon. In the interview I was asked about the subjects
   I had taken that semester, a question on casting defects, some welding
   question I don’t even remember, a question on pressure vessels and the
   pressure components associated with them (Hoop stress etc.) and a
   general question on the role of a mechanical engineer in an industry
   like Reliance. It was over in less than ten minutes. I assumed that I
   had been disappointing and was hence dismissed early. Went back to my
   room in a very bad mood and if not for the salt, I might have really
   lost it. I slept off only to be woken up much later to Tintin calling
   me to TnP. The results were about to be announced and I didn’t want to
   go there to be rejected for a fifth time. But then I got a call telling
   me that I’d got it. The feeling is hard to describe. You only get it
   once in your life. I went there to TnP in my shabby jeans and FSUK
   shirt, got the offer letter, was asked about my attire and berated by
   the Reliance guys for not having enough confidence in myself. I told my
   loved ones about it, went back to my room and wore three layers of
   underwear and also my then redundant ankle crepe bandage in a vain
   effort to protect myself against the barbarism that was to follow. My
   butt was blue and pink for a week after that.
   Well that was it, the day I got my first job. I honestly don’t know why
   I wrote this long post, but maybe it has something to do with the
   absolute lack of work I’m facing now. Hardly any classes anyway in
   college and now I’m on holiday. Getting placed has been a relief and
   the whole process leading up to it, a memorable experience. Thought I’d
   share it with you. Hopefully the next post shall be a little less
   boring and narcissistic.
   And oh, for those of you who are looking for something better than
   placements, here is a pretty informative blog by a friend of mine

[26]Expected.

   This blog post, that’s what was expected. I usually get all passionate
   and emotional at these moments. Days of national importance,
   significant political developments and even sporting events (ICC World
   Cup final 2011 takes the cake of course) seem to have a special
   significance in my admittedly insignificant life. What difference does
   it make if this one wannabe engineer talks and types about events which
   have absolutely no dependence on him? Well, I honestly can’t answer
   that. But I shall blog anyway.
   So, 65 years of Independence. Cool eh? 65 years of absolutely no
   interference from outside, total peace and calm for us as a country to
   progress. That is time more than enough for a country with abundant
   energy resources, safe and secure boundaries, absolutely no problems of
   cultural differences and languages to kick ass as a country. We should
   have become a superpower by now. Damn those ‘politicians’, if not for
   them we’d have been living the life, I’d have been posting this from my
   4G LTE handset, Kasab would be selling meat in his village, India would
   have got 40 golds at the Olympics, we’d be enjoying 20% growth when
   Greece and Iceland were going kaput and Rajni’s films would be winning
   Oscars, right?
   Well, if you’re one of those who subscribe to the views mentioned
   towards the end of the previous paragraph, the beginning of the same
   paragraph should set you right. Study history, do some useful googling
   about our demographics, reflect on what you are thinking of as a career
   right now (and why) and you will think twice before complaining. This
   post was triggered by two things. One was a very whiny tweet by someone
   complaining about how backward we are and the other, an article I came
   across on Wikipedia.
   ([27]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryst_with_destiny)
   That speech was made by a true statesman. It summarised a dream seen by
   our founding fathers (and mothers?). Poor and rich alike, those people
   fought like tigers in their unique ways to win independence for a
   collection of states and provinces that had no previous wish to be
   together. Yes, if you have illusions regarding some ancient united
   India, please go study history. If you want, I’ll write another post
   some other time. We had a soul as a country, just as Nehru said. But
   the body took an oppressor’s whip to take form.  India as we know it is
   all about the last one, or maybe two centuries. We came together to
   throw the English out, make no mistakes about that. And even if that is
   the case, why should we not feel proud about that? We, my fellow
   Indian, are privileged participants in the greatest geopolitical
   experiment in history. Note the word participants. We don’t need a
   history of zillions of years as a ‘country’ to be proud. The past
   century by itself is enough to put every other country to shame. Pay
   attention to what happens every 5 years here (next one in 2014), and
   you will understand why we are special.
   Anyway, the dream... Those gutsy people fought and won. And what did
   they do after that? They went home, ‘scammed’ and lived out their lives
   in gluttony and hedonism right? Nope. They sat together for years more
   and wrote a huge book. A gargantuan book with ideas from all around the
   globe, literally. They dreamt big, but they also worked hard to realise
   it, or at least tried to enable their kids in realising it. They gave
   us something called the Constitution. I’m sure it must have been their
   pride and joy, something that made their eyes moist every time they
   thought about it. Think of the examination you just wrote after weeks
   of hard study or the racing car you made last year (if you get this
   part, mail me them Hungarian chocolates). Feeling coming-aa? Yes,
   that’s what they felt about their gift to us.
   Why am I trying to get you all sentimental? Because of what is
   transpiring around us. Members of ‘civil society’ propping up freedom
   fighters and self-styled ‘holy’ men playing with religious sentiments
   to further their vested interests, the assassin of the Mahatma is
   touted as a hero of some sorts on social media, political parties look
   to do nothing more than gain power in the next election (or even cause
   premature elections at huge monetary loss to the nation), vigilante
   groups giving excuses of ‘culture’ to satisfy their own disgusting
   desires, media houses looking to do nothing but increase their TRPs
   (which by themselves seem to be flawed, going by recent [28]reports)...
   The list goes on. And the worst part is, we educated youth are getting
   disillusioned everyday by this mockery of the Constitution. We fail to
   see how this most cherished gift of our founders is being tarnished
   every day. Some ask for direct presidential elections, others ask for
   some whimsical ‘right-to-recall’... Are these the words of people who
   are genuinely aware of what our country, our Republic is all about? In
   his speech Nehru said the following words,
   "To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an
   appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure.
   This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for
   ill-will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of free
   India where all her children may dwell."
   So much faith and enthusiasm in pursuing this adventure right? Well,
   this post wasn’t meant to be some lecture on what we should do. But
   I’ll tell you what we shouldn’t do, we shouldn’t complain without
   knowing the facts. We shouldn’t make a mockery of those who gave our
   country to us or of their plan for us. Our crowning glory, our pride
   and our country’s foundation, the Constitution is being attacked every
   day. Don’t be a part of it, at least not without getting your facts
   right.
   The time for India to redeem that pledge fully is very far (not 2020,
   much further). But she is doing it bit by bit, be sure of that. I shall
   end with just one, simple suggestion based on Chacha Nehru’s speech.
   “The responsibility rests upon this Assembly, a sovereign body
   representing the sovereign people of India.”
   Help her in redeeming that pledge. Don’t ask for a cool President to
   appear out of thin air. Go vote!
   Jai Hind, seriously.
   P.S. By the way, I am a fortunate student of an NIT, part of a system
   of institutions of higher learning where merit ALONE (definition
   recently messed with, but merit all the same) can get you a seat and
   that too at dirt cheap rates. There are many such institutes in India.
   I’m not telling this to boast about myself, believe me I’m not. But
   just research admission procedures at all those awesome Western
   universities we all want to go to, and you will feel somewhat, if not
   very proud of the ‘system’ we all hate.

[40]Man United, not ManU!

   Manchester United. Looong post, be warned.
   Inevitable I guess, me writing about this. Those who follow football
   will wonder about the timing however. Why am I writing about United
   when they have lost their title to the worst possible opposition, in
   the most painful manner? Well, those who TRULY follow football will
   know why. United is one of the most successful clubs in world football.
   Yet that isn’t what’s special about this club. United inspire awe,
   wonder and even hate for one trait, to which I shall come back later.
   Or maybe not.
   I started following football during the 2006 WC. I randomly started
   supporting England, having heard of Rooney and Beckham before. Yes, as
   much as we would like to pretend, for most of us over here in India,
   that is how the football mania begins. In essence, we are all
   cricketiyas J For me, football seemed all the more attractive as a
   sport. I was tired of always being the one who dropped catches while
   fielding, who bowled more wides than proper ones and who almost always
   went last to bat. Football wasn’t about ‘one mistake and you’re out’.
   In football, you could suck all through the game and no one would
   notice. I know, good reason right? Anyway, I liked football. And the
   firangis played it better. So, I started watching.
   I saw the Ronaldo-Rooney bust up and got curious about the team for
   which these two played normally. So, I started watching the EPL that
   season. I have an uncle who supports Arsenal, and I’d watched the
   Arsenal vs Barcelona Champions League final with him once (or was it
   after 2006?). That was all the background I had till then. But I
   immediately fell in love with the team. United had this sense of speed
   and forcefulness I didn’t see in any other EPL team at that time.
   Arsenal were in a kind of recession, and were playing their own version
   of tiki-taka without any results (and they continue to do so, which is
   a shame really). Liverpool were under Rafael Benitez. Enough said.
   Chelsea were the kings at that time. Tyrants, led by the special one.
   Jose Mourinho was indeed a brilliant manager, and had established what
   one of the most effective teams as far as winning a league goes. And it
   was left to United to do something about it.
   It was during that season that I saw the greatest midfielder of his
   generation, Paul Scholes. I mean, this guy’s passes were brilliant.
   Quick and incisive short passes, and lobs from another world. And he
   had the perfect target to aim for. Wayne Rooney. Temperamental,
   passionate, foul-mouthed and now United’s heartbeat, this guy could
   pluck those long passes out of the air as though the ball was a magnet
   and his boots were iron. Or vice versa. Ryan Giggs, the EPL version of
   Tendulkar. This guy had been playing for what 15 or more years by then,
   and he was still ripping teams apart from the wing. Give Ryan Giggs an
   inclined board in front of goal and 1 second on the wing, and you have
   a goal. Cristiano Ronaldo with his stepovers, speed, killer free kicks
   and unsurpassed cockiness chipped in with almost as many goals as the
   strikers. I remember Saha used to play for us back then.  The other two
   players I really admired were Nemanja Vidic, our brilliant CB whose
   absence cost us the league this time and Edwin van der Sar. VDS was a
   brilliant keeper, perhaps United’s second greatest after Schmeichel.
   But more than that, it was like having an extra outfield player. VDS’s
   ball distribution was simply superb, comparable to Pepe Reina’s.
   Anyway, that first season I saw United destroy Roma in the CL
   semi-final 7-1. That game defined United for me. Counter attacking at
   its best. United didn’t pass the ball all the time or have insane
   dribblers. Or not that many atleast. But just the sight of those red
   shirts running at full pelt, scaring the shit out of the opposition, it
   was amazing.
   We bowed out of the CL to AC Milan, who at the time were still giants.
   They still are actually. With the departure of great but highly paid
   stars, they’re sure gonna be able attract some real good talent next
   season. AC Milan, the team I like most in the Serie A. Ok, so we were
   out of the CL. Anyway, that was ok. That first season, I saw United
   lift the Premier League title again. I didn’t know much about them yet,
   but I saw what it meant to United. The Premier League was everything to
   United. United had ended Chelsea’s reign. And thats when it started.
   The next few years were glorious. Ronaldo was the main driving force.
   He scored goals like crazy despite being a winger, and Rooney played
   the perfect partner. We had Nani coming in, Carrick was there.
   Anderson, the da Silva twins and many more. The 2007-08 season we
   wrapped up the League title with ease. But there was more. I watched my
   second CL final, this time with a team to support. Cristiano had scored
   a brilliant opener with a header. But United didn’t finish things off
   early and Chelsea got back into it with a typical helter skelter goal
   from the overhyped Lampard, who celebrates his fluke goals as though he
   meant every little deflection. I seriously don’t like him Gerrard is
   better. Anyway, the game went to penalties after a very heated last few
   minutes. And who better to miss the penalty than our man, Cristiano. Of
   all the people, he missed as he had done in the SF against Barcelona
   (oh yes, people can defeat Barcelona by playing football). John Terry
   stepped up to take the winner. And he slipped. I hate being negative,
   but that moment is one which I shall savor for ever. And then, VDS
   saved Anelka’s penalty. Manchester United were kings of Europe again J
   [41][Man-Utd-07-08-Wallpapers-manchester-united-2428115-1280-960.jpg]
   I grew even more crazy about United. Ronaldo was at the height of his
   powers and was scoring goals for fun. Berbatov was there, scoring
   insane goals at leisure. And we had the engine of Rooney, Scholes,
   Carrick, Fletcher, Giggs, Vidic, Rio and the others. We won the title
   again. And a few teacups along the way. Chelsea regained the title
   once, but we had won it thrice by then. United were back, and I was
   hooked on to United for life.
   I didn’t realise how crazy I was about United till the end of the
   20080-09 season. One of the greatest comebacks at the Old Trafford
   happened that night (night in India). We defeated Spurs in a season
   defining game. But what was more special, even ominous for me, was what
   loomed the next day. Not something I write about where my mum can see
   it anyway :P
   [42][240191468.jpg]
   Why are United so successful? Do United have no problems at all? Well,
   read about the [43]Glazers. I'd rather not get angry and start using
   the beautiful words. United have a history, a proud history. we have
   overcome adversity time and time again. Not just on the pitch, but
   elsewhere too. If you've time, read [44]this.
   But if you want to read something really awesome, read [45]this. This
   man is Manchester United, as far as our generation goes. I know, how
   lazy can I be right, with all the links? Well, if you want, you can
   stop reading now. Its ok. Just check out the previous link before
   leaving though.
   Some other moments I cherish are the title wins, the Macheda goal
   against Aston Villa, the Scholes screamer against Barca with Messi
   looking on, the CL knockout win against Arsenal, seeing the 1999 CL
   final for the first time, the 8-2 over Arsenal this season, the Rooney
   bicycle kick against City last season and the way we lost to Bayern in
   the CL QFs.
   I’ll tell you why all these matter, even the loss. It’s because they
   are example of the thing I love most about United. United thrive on
   adversity. We just never give up. Love them or hate them, a United team
   in full flow is one of the most electrifying sights in football.
   United set the standard in England. Atleast as far as the PL era goes,
   United have been the one constant in England. Even now, when our noisy
   neighbours splashed their money around and other teams whimpered, we
   stepped up to the plate and gave City hell. We are still at the
   pinnacle of English football. United can only improve. I’d have said
   we’ll be back. But seriously, have we gone anywhere?
   United, for life J
   P.S. You shall not refer to United as ManU and call yourself a fan. It
   is a derogatory term used by our rivals in connection with a tragic
   incident. Thank you :)

   The past few weeks...
   A blog entry after quite some time. I’ve been quite busy over the past
   few weeks. Exams kept me occupied from the day before the first to
   three days before the last (refer to our crazy time tables for further
   details). I’ll go on typing whatever comes to my mind. The stuff I say
   might not even be in chronological order.
   Incident and midsems...
   The highlight of my month so far (and this holds good for most of my
   college mates at NITK) was our college cult fest Incident. The Fest To
   Die For, The End Of The World Party and other titles abound, the fest
   really was a masterclass in planning and finances, from what little I
   saw of the workings behind it. With a dedicated bunch of students
   working on everything from how to get the money for the fest to how to
   spend it, Incident ’12 was perhaps the most meticulously and creatively
   conceived fest to date. Few people from outside NITK (or even inside
   for that matter) realise why Incident is different. Let me put it
   simply. EVERYTHING that happens is handled by students. Whatever can go
   right is done by students. Whatever can go wrong... well let’s just say
   that is taken care of by enemies both foreign and domestic (I’m sorely
   tempted to use emoticons right now, but I won’t. Instead, I shall
   continue to misuse parentheses). Anyway, there you go. Incident ’12
   happened, but not quite as we planned it.
   The Empire struck. Well actually it did not strike, it just lay back in
   its cool cloistered abode and watched the dream of its ‘subjects’ come
   crashing down. Incident ’12 was an example of how the actions of many
   can be negated by the inaction of a few.  The midsems came and went in
   the week before Incident and now we await the results of the same. I’m
   not even bothering to cross my fingers.
   Notice the amount of space Incident took up in comparison with the part
   about tests? That should tell you the story.
   Our consolation was a performance by a GNR tribute band, Jailbreak. I
   heard that this was pretty good, and so was the opening act by a local
   band which actually performed Tulu rock songs! I missed it all as I had
   to leave for Bangalore that night.
   Tiruchi Venganur Sundaram...
   Yup, that’s the full form of TVS which I finally checked after a very
   namkeen reminder. Why TVS? Well, a week before our midsems, we had a
   test conducted in college. It was on a Saturday, and for once I
   actually took the effort to go back to college on a Saturday. The test
   was by TVS Motocorp, who by the way make 3 wheelers as well, to hire
   (on what seems like a subsistence wage basis) a few young engineers to
   work for them over the summer. To be honest, before I wrote the test I
   wasn’t even sure the Apache was a TVSM product. Yes, I still aim to be
   a mechanical engineer.
   Anyway, I wrote the test. After some really shady elimination process
   (inverted pyramid stuff, I tell you!) 14 of us Mechies were invited to
   their plant in Hosur for a day. So, back to the last day of Incident.
   While the rest of the college swayed to the tunes, or whatever it was
   they did, of Jailbreak, we set off for Bangalore. I won’t tell you
   stories of my trip to Blore. But I shall give a few points.  I like
   saying things in points.
   1. Never switch off your Nokia 7210 thinking you’ll conserve battery
   life. You’ll end up without a mobile for days. Unfortunately for me,
   this happened on this trip. Allow me to say “Saavu marre!”.
   2. Bangalore, despite the myths, doesn’t always have great weather.
   3. If any place needs a change of name, it is the supposedly Majestic
   bus stand of Bangalore.
   4. Cousins are indeed your first and best friends for life, no matter
   how infrequently you meet.
   5. Infosys, Biocon and all those fancy companies you hear about are NOT
   in Bangalore. They’re a torturous bus ride away. And Hosur is in Tamil
   Nadu.
   6. TVS Motors has one of the finest manufacturing/assembling facilities
   for bikes in India.
   7. Songwriters beware. The Tamil film industry is always on the lookout
   to ‘improve’ your songs.
   8. We seriously need a national language. I vote for Tulu.
   9. But seriously, I vote for English.
   10. No one knows Bangalore, which in my opinion is a case study on how
   NOT to connect a city. If you have so many awesome places (which you
   do, no doubt), please set up an efficient transport system.
   11. I saw the Manchester United bar. I just saw it.
   12. Mangalore Special Bhel Puri exists. Supposedly we make it sweet.
   13. If you want a cool new phone, please don’t take your recently
   deceased phone to the service centre.
   Well, that should be enough for now.  I’m trying my best to keep this
   blog from turning into a diary and yes, I’m failing miserably. Time for
   an abrupt ending.
   No seriously, that’s it.

[66]Infinity Pack Abs

   I guess you might be wondering what Infinity Pack abs are. Well, you
   need a basic understanding of calculus for that. This picture (is it
   there? I used the URL) might help.
   [67][transform_pairs_3.gif]
   Six packs, Eight packs and other such physical attributes seem to be
   all the rage these days. However, what perplexes me is that even those
   with a background in mathematics (read ALL ENGINEERS) seem to drool
   over this phenomenon. Why? Because Infinity Packs are even cooler! Let
   me explain...
   Fourier Transformations are basically used to convert continuous curves
   to discreet ones right? Like, sinusoidal inputs to ones which computers
   and their minions can make sense of. Basically chopping off the major
   part and keeping the high and low states.
   The guys (or girls) with a discreet amount of abs are on the right side
   of the graphic, while we infinity packs are on the left. We just have
   so many abs that they form a continuous curve which average eyes cannot
   see! We are the ones with more abs, infinitely more abs than SRK, Aamir
   or Esha Deol.
   I hope this makes many people feel better about themselves (or makes
   them wish that I stop blogging, anything will do). Thank you.
   PS: If you notice, the transformation is reversible. The catalysts (or
   more specifically, the functions) are gluttony and exercise.

[76]The Brainwave

   I recently had a brainwave. That I should blog. Turns out I had such a
   brainwave over a year ago as well. I had actually opened a Blogger
   account and posted something, something cheesy. Well that was Swiss.
   Time to add some cheddar.
   Why am I blogging? Because I want to share my thoughts with the world,
   pour out my feelings into cyberspace for the world to see, to improve
   my writing (typing?) skills. Because in half the interviews I faced so
   far, I've been asked if I blog. Because I want to say yes the next time
   I am asked that. Good reasons eh?
   YEAH RIGHT! I'm blogging because I'm jobless, and am too lazy to drag
   my laptop over to my ex-roomie's room to.... ahem, work. Last year we
   used to 'work' through LAN. I'll cover the lack of LAN in another post.
   Or maybe even this one.
   What should my first (technically second) post be about? Well, I
   thought I'd write about myself, but then again, I thought better of it.
   Its better to let you decide if you want to know about me, so I'll be
   filling up the About Me thingy after I post this. I guess the title of
   my blog should be a much more interesting topic. EGG HALF FRY!
   [77][fried_eggs.jpg]
   Again, I can give you many awesome and deep stuff about the symbolism
   of such a title. An egg half fried, a half baked cookie, a jack of all
   trades but a master of none, crisp on the outside but soft in the
   middle (wait for it, don't gag yet!) or a boy who is turning into a man
   (there you go, now you can gag).... All that. But there's a simple and
   logical explanation. Yesterday I found out that I had the whole morning
   free, so I stayed up till after 1 in the morning. That's when I decided
   to act on my brainwave (that of "I shall blog" fame). But then I got
   hungry, so I visited the NC ([78]must click!) and had the usual-  "Onji
   half fry bread, radd vada pav bokka lassi."
   Yes, that is what I eat at midnight. I do this more often these days
   because the toilets in my new wing are usually not in a state where you
   first need to empty two bucketfuls of water mixed with shampoo before
   you can use them. Usually. Okay, lets not digress (awesome dialog,
   fetches you ten points in every group discussion!). I came back to my
   room... no, I CLIMBED back to my 4th floor room (the [79]infinity pack
   abs stand testament to this routine) and set about 'designing' my blog.
   And naturally, the first thing that came to my mind was THE
   dish. Well that's the story of the title. I guess the description
   doesn't need any... description.
   I guess that's pretty much what I want to say for now. No, I want to
   say a lot more. But I am at home for the weekend and I really need to
   sleep. If you found this post bearable, please do come again. Hum blog
   kartein rahenge, aap aao ya na aao. No seriously, do come again! :) (I
   just HAD to put in a smiley!)
