Holiday Cottages Northumberland


   Grace Darling Holidays has over 40 years of experience in offering
   individually styled cottages for your perfect getaway to the North East
   of England. We are experts in creating that home from home stay and
   offer beautiful self-catering coastal retreats along the picturesque
   Northumberland coast.


   The area of Northumberland is steeped in natural beauty and ancient
   history, making it a truly special place to create lasting memories.
   Our cottages are perfect for everyone. They are ideal for couples
   looking for a romantic weekend, or a luxury escape, to families and
   friends searching for a home away from home with all the thoughtful
   comforts and touches that make your stay with us even more special. Our
   cottages can be found in quaint villages and prime locations including
   Beadnell, Seahouses, Bamburgh and Newton-by-the-Sea. Choose from cosy
   cottages, barn conversions and townhouses, to one very special country
   manor. What’s more most are pet-friendly so there’s no need to leave a
   special family member behind.


   There are also plenty of attractions to explore that are right on your
   doorstep. The Grace Darling Museum, the World Heritage Site Hadrian’s
   Wall, historic castles, acres of golden beaches, miles of rocky cliffs
   and woodlands that will keep you all entertained for days.


Holiday Cottages Fort Augustus, Scotland


   This special collection of Scottish apartments and holiday cottages are
   in an ideal location for a break north of the border. Each property can
   be found in a converted Benedictine monastery on the banks of Loch
   Ness, nestled in 20 acres of private gardens. Each property is unique
   and unforgettable with original historic features that include all the
   mod cons to make your stay an exceptional one.

   Enjoy the surrounding space and facilities in the Highland Club
   including a restaurant, bar, sauna, steam room and swimming pool.
   Outdoors there’s a children’s adventure play area, barbecue spots and
   croquet lawns for you to join in and have some fun. If you fancy
   venturing further afield, don’t miss out on visiting Loch Ness and see
   if you can spot the infamous Loch Ness monster.


   There are also plenty of historic castles within easy reach for day
   trips, and the scenic towns of Fort William and Inverness are nearby
   too. Enjoy the scenery, exhilarating walks, seafood lunches, tranquil
   fishing or indulge in a game of golf. Whatever you fancy doing, there’s
   plenty going on.
